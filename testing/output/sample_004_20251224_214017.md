I’ll be glad to take your questions. So, I’ll just say that the economy is in a strong position, and we think the outlook for the economy is a favorable one. As I mentioned, we see the risks to the outlook as broadly balanced. For households and businesses, conditions in the economy are supporting spending and investment. The labor market is strong. Inflation is coming down toward our 2 percent longer run goal. And that’s all the more reason, we think, for us to be careful about policy so that we don’t interfere with this progress. We also think that our policy is in a good place. The real economy is doing pretty well now. And as you can see, we’ve laid out our individual forecasts for this year and next. The median for this year is an [expected] real GDP [growth] rate of 2.1 percent, with unemployment at 4.5 percent, and that’s just a tenth higher than our December estimates. So it’s a very similar forecast. For 2025, the median forecast is 2.1 percent as well [in real GDP], with unemployment at 4.3 percent, a tenth higher than in December. So, again, not much of a change. You ask about inflation. The forecast for this year is 2.7 percent core, 2.4 percent headline, just a few tenths higher than in December. And I guess, as I say, that’s not a big change for a combination of reasons. We’ve seen higher oil prices, which are pushing up headline but not core inflation. We’ve seen some pass through of those higher oil prices into [increases in] services inflation, which is why you see a modest increase in core inflation. But we also see that inflation is expected to come back down in 2025 to just above 2 percent, which is just a tenth higher than in December. So, again, not a big change. I would say, though, that, you know, our policy is based on our outlook, and our outlook is based on the incoming data. So if data come in that are meaningfully different from this, our policy could very well be different as well.

So, you know, we watch both the labor market and inflation, and we have a dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices. So, really, the question is, how do they trade off? And that’s going to depend on the nature of the tradeoff. So I think we have to be alert not to sacrifice the gains that we’ve made on either side. But I would say, right now, we do see the risks to the two goals as broadly in balance. We see the labor market as strong, but it’s gradually cooling gradually, so it’s coming back into better balance with supply and demand. And we see inflation as gradually coming down. So that’s the assessment. You know, it’s always going to be a challenging judgment, but this doesn’t feel like that case where one of the two is clearly more pressing than the other. They’re sort of calling for the same decision, and that decision is, we think, to stay where we are, to be patient, and to let the situation clarify.

So there’s a lot of uncertainty around that, as you well know. But I, I would say this: The economy is in a strong position, and we think the outlook for the economy is a good one. The economy’s performed extremely well over the past two years, and that’s despite higher inflation, which has now mostly passed, and also despite higher interest rates, which are now lower than they were when the pandemic, you know, hit. That’s a that’s a really good outcome for the economy. And so that’s what we see. I would also say, though, that there are risks out there, and we need to be careful that we don’t, you know, interfere with that favorable outlook by, by doing too much or too little, and that’s why we’re being patient and letting the situation clarify.

So, you know, I would say it this way. You see the incoming data have, have been so mixed since the December meeting, right? You see some data points that are so you have seen I won’t go through them all, but, but they’re can be seen as, as suggesting a stronger economy. You’ve also seen some, you know, data that suggest the opposite the latest unemployment claim data, for example. So it’s very hard to know. I would say the right thing to do, really, is to wait for greater clarity, because, you know, we think our policy is in a good place. It’s, it’s appropriately restrictive. We think it’s putting downward pressure on economic activity and toward bringing inflation down to 2 percent. But, as I said, the situation is quite uncertain, so we’re going to wait and see some clearer data before we make any decision about, about our policy.

So, you’re right. We did see a number of interesting, or notable, new surveys of workers and firms that came out a couple weeks ago, and what they say is essentially that, you know, the shortages that, that really define a pandemic economy have mostly gone away, but so has a lot of hiring. And so what you have now is people going back to work, but it’s not the kind of overheated labor market where demand for workers substantially exceeds the supply, and, and, you know, that’s not where we are anymore. We’re more back to a strong but more normal level of demand for workers. So that’s what the surveys say. And that’s what we’re seeing in the data. That’s why we think it’s appropriate to have our policy stance where it is, at 4.3 percent. That’s, that’s a restrictive stance, but it’s not as restrictive as it was it’s not as tight as it was earlier this year when, when the economy was performing so well against this headwind.

You know, we would take, a number of different things. First, we’d take more data, and, and I just said what the data are doing. They’re, they’re showing both, you know, higher readings and lower readings, and so that’s why we think it’s we think we need to see more data to know what is real and what, and what isn’t just a reading that’s going to reverse. We’d also, you know, we’d also be looking for, you know, further progress on inflation. That would be the other thing. You know, it would be if we do what we think we need to do, which is to wait for further clarity, and if that gives us a clearer picture and it says that policy needs to move in a different direction, then that would be a reason for us to move. But that’s, that’s not what we expect, but that’s, that’s what it would take.

I don’t think I’ve ever kept track of the number of times we’ve said that, but we’ve said it many times. But, you know, it’s not just a question of saying it. We have to act on it, right? So what have we done? We’ve, we’ve cut our policy rate by 175 basis points since last September. And I think that this, this action is consistent with our commitment. We were patient for a year. We waited last year. We, you know, we waited until we were really confident that inflation was coming down, that we could be confident in that, and then we began to reduce rates by 75 basis points last year. We reduced them by 50 basis points this December and by another 25 basis points today. So I think we have acted. We haven’t just said we’re going to be patient. We have patiently waited for conditions to meet our, our strict requirements for taking these actions.

So I guess I’d start by saying that our policy is not designed or intended to produce a recession a technical recession, a mild one, or otherwise. That’s not the idea. The idea is, we’re trying to achieve 2 percent inflation over time and sustain it, and we think we do that ultimately in the service of having a strong labor market over time as well. And we think that our policy is right now in a good place where we don’t think we need to be either in a hurry or, or the opposite, too patient. We think we think that our policy is in a good place, but the situation is highly uncertain, and that’s why we’re waiting to see clearer data before we make a decision.

So it’s been a while since we’ve, we’ve, you know, had a month like June, where we had two really strong employment reports in a row and also some other reports that suggested a stronger economy. That was right around the end of June, I guess it was. And so we started thinking, “Maybe the economy is stronger.” But then that gave way to other readings, and we’ve seen a number of readings that suggest a slower economy, so we’ve gone back and forth. And that’s why I think, given that uncertainty, the right thing is, is to wait for, you know, for more data that clarifies the direction of the economy.

So I’m not going to comment on, on any particular forecast, but I would say, generally, you know, forecasts have been coming in higher than expected, right? But they also were coming in lower than expected, and now they’re coming in higher. I think it’s a it’s a volatile thing. We’ve also seen forecasts for other economies around the world coming in higher and then coming in lower. It’s just it’s difficult to forecast in this era. It’s a it’s a challenging thing to do, and, you know, so, you know, we’re
