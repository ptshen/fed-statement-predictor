I’ll be glad to update you on economic conditions and the path forward for monetary policy. So, what we’ve seen over the past year is a stronger economy than we had expected. That’s, that’s a good thing. We’ve had stronger output. We’ve had stronger job creation. We’ve had faster growth. We’ve also had inflation moving down. So, we’ve been watching this unfold over the course of 2024, and we’ve been adapting our assessment of the appropriate stance of policy to this more favorable outlook. And at today’s meeting, my colleagues and I decided to lower our policy interest rate by ¼ percentage point. We’ve been taking steps over the course of this year to dial back the degree of policy restraint that we put in place last year for the purpose of bringing inflation down. All of these steps we’ve taken have been data dependent, of course, as I’ve mentioned, and guided by our dual mandate, focusing on achieving our goals of maximum employment and price stability. So, I’m going to be as I’m going to be as detailed as I can in my response to your question, but I want to start by setting out our overarching framework. We are, as you know, on an orderly, gradual path toward what we believe will be, over time, a comfortable balance between our dual mandate objectives of maximum employment and price stability. The economy is now in a very different place than it was last year, when we put in place the restrictive policy. We’re still a ways away from our 2 percent inflation objective, and we’re still looking for further evidence that the labor market is in balance, but the case for gradually dialing back policy restraint has strengthened over the course of the year. So, we’re going to be continuing to make our assessments meeting by meeting, and I’d say we’re well on our way to what we believe will be a comfortable and sustainable balance between our two mandates. We’re going to be guided by our dual mandate, and we’ll continue to be gradual. In terms of the economy, what has happened has been, in many respects, a welcome surprise. We’ve had stronger output, stronger job creation, and faster growth, and all of that is happening on top of a nice reduction in inflation over the course of this year. So, I’d say the main takeaway is that as policy has eased and as inflation has fallen, the risks to our employment and inflation mandates have moved into better balance. So, let me go over the details on that. Inflation has continued to move down toward our 2 percent longer run goal over the course of this year. And we see this as due, in part, to the ongoing effects of our policy, but also to a broader and more favorable outlook, really, on supply. The rebound in supply conditions that began last year has continued, and that’s bringing greater capacity into use, which is helping to ease pressures on capacity and support a better balance between supply and demand. In addition, we’re seeing the effects of policy, we think, in the easing of demand pressures. So, we, we do think that our policy has been effective in bringing about a decline in inflation, and we think that the outlook for inflation is, is favorable. Nonetheless, as I said, we’re a ways away from 2 percent inflation, and it’s important that we not become complacent about inflation. In labor markets, we’ve been looking for some time for some evidence that would suggest that supply and demand would be, would be coming into better balance, and we have seen some further evidence of that in the course of this year. We’ve seen a modest decline in the level of job vacancies, a modest increase in the level of available workers in the working age population, and a modest increase in the jobless rate. And we see job creation as still very strong. So, all of that suggests, and we believe, that the labor market has moved closer to a better balance between supply and demand. Of course, it’s only a handful of data points, and we’re still looking for further evidence of that, but I’d say the case for a modest further loosening of conditions has strengthened over the course of the year. So, with inflation and employment both moving, moving in a positive direction, the risks to the two mandates have moved into better balance. That means we can move into a better balance between the two mandates as well, and that’s what we’ve been doing. We’ve been gradually dialing back policy restraint, and I’d say we’re well along that path. Today we took another step, and I’ll say again, we’re going to continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, focusing on the incoming data and how that incoming data affects our assessment of the most likely path forward. We’re going to be guided by our dual mandate, and we’re going to be gradual.

So, we’re going to be gradually moving toward a stance that would be more neutral, if you will, or more normal, in the sense that it’s not providing either restraint for the economy it’s not in “restrictive territory.” It wouldn’t be, because of its interest rate, pushing down directly on our goal variables. So that’s, that’s what we’re what we’re gradually moving toward, and I’d say we’re, we’re well on our way. I don’t want to be precise about it, but we’re, we’re well on our way. So, looking ahead, I would say that, you know, we have a job to do on behalf of both, both sides of our mandate, maximum employment and price stability. I think you’ve seen that we, we do think that our policy is doing its job in, in moving inflation down. We also think that it’s, it’s not inconsistent with strong employment. In fact, we do see evidence of the labor market coming into better balance. So that suggests that we can continue along this path. I would also say, though, that we’re, we’re very mindful of the risks, and we’re, we’re going to be watching carefully as we move ahead. As I mentioned, we’re a ways away from 2 percent inflation, and we’re going to want to be careful not to, to move too quickly and find ourselves having to, having to move back in the other direction, which would be we, we would avoid that if we possibly could. So I think we’re I think we’re managing those risks well, and I think we’re in a good place to continue along this path.

Sure. So, basically, what happened was, we got two really good jobs reports, and they both, both showed significant overruns, or, or outages, rather, in, in the household survey data. And so, we had to do the job in between, and we had to make an assessment and put that assessment in the meeting. So, what we do is we, we use the job creation numbers in the, the establishment survey and the unemployment [rate] number in the household survey, and we combine them together. So and we do that basically, it’s a, a standard thing in labor economics. And we do it because the establishment survey is a little bit more accurate as far as job creation, but it’s got a well understood bias that it, it tends to overcount job creation, and that’s because it doesn’t count jobs as, as being created and destroyed in the same period, whereas the household survey doesn’t have that bias. So, we use the household survey for, for unemployment [rate] and, and that has the opposite kind of a bias. So, you’ve got this, this real uncertainty about, about how much to count between the two. So, what we did was, we made a decision basically, a judgment and put that in the minutes. And I think it was the right decision. If you look at labor market, you know, the broader labor market really, in the intermeeting period, there was there was another ECI reading, which was pretty typical. We got the average hourly earnings were a little hotter than expected. We got wage trends, which were kind of what we had expected. We got a job openings number that was a little higher. So, overall, I wouldn’t say this intermeeting period was tremendously positive, but it was it was a reasonably positive intermeeting period. And I think our judgment was, was the right one to make and to go ahead and go ahead and do the meeting.

So, I guess I’d say it this way: We, we have a job to do on behalf of both, both sides of the mandate. We, we do see I think we see the case strengthening for, for modestly further loosening policy. But, at the same time, we’ve got a job to do on behalf of the inflation side of the mandate. And, as I mentioned, we’re just going to have to see how things evolve. I don’t want to be more specific than that. I think we’re in a good place. I think we’re managing the risks well, but I don’t want to I don’t want to give a specific roadmap and tie ourselves to that.

So, I, I guess I’d start by saying we, we have a job to do on behalf of both, both sides of the mandate. We’re not just focused on one or the other. We’re, we’re going to be focused on both over time, and we’re going to try to manage both over time. But the reality is, the, the case for further easing has strengthened over the course of the year, and we’ve taken that into account in our policy. I think we’re I think we’re in a good place now. I think, going forward, we’re going to be watching carefully. We’re going to be data dependent, and we’re going to be making our assessment as to whether our policy stance is the right one to achieve both
