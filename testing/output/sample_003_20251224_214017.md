I’ll be glad to lay out how the Federal Reserve is thinking about the economy and our policy. So, as you know, we just concluded our two-day meeting, and our monetary policy committee again judged that recent economic and financial developments warrant caution as we evaluate the appropriate stance of policy. Let me say more about the economic backdrop. The economy posted a surprisingly robust pace of growth last year, the strongest in decades. And this outcome has important implications for our outlook and for our policy. The main reasons for the stronger growth were the unexpectedly rapid reopening of the economy in the early months of last year, followed by a surge in hiring as labor supply unexpectedly returned to a rising trend, bringing the size of the labor shortage down substantially. And these developments led to an unforeseen decline in inflation’s momentum last year, as weakening in supply chains reversed, in whole or in part, the price increases that had boosted inflation’s momentum in the latter half of 2020. Now, it is important that we be humble about our ability to predict the future, but that’s our baseline outlook, and it’s consistent with what outside forecasters generally think. And, in that baseline outlook, the U.S. economy is on track to register a full percentage point more in growth this year than we had expected at the end of last year, with inflation’s return to our 2 percent longer run goal also likely to be delayed by a few months. But there are risks, of course, and, in particular, there is some evidence that the economy may be cooling, so we are carefully monitoring the incoming data. In our Committee’s baseline, the decline in growth is temporary and the labor market will remain strong, supporting incomes and spending and keeping inflation in check. If that’s the case, our policy will, and must, reflect that outlook. But if the cooling were to continue, that could create tension between our two mandate goals, maximum employment and price stability, and we would take that into consideration in setting our policy. Real income for most households rose at an impressive pace last year after adjusting for inflation, enabled by strong wage growth and the very large gains from the rise in housing values. And, for many Americans, the return of a robust labor market has been a lifeline during these difficult times. Our policy is designed to support the economy in getting through the pandemic and to foster a period of strong employment and price stability that will benefit Americans for years to come. We will continue to use our tools to help achieve these goals. Thanks, and I’ll be glad to take your questions.

Sure. So and that’s an ex post measure, right? That’s a measure that’s calculated after the fact. We won’t know, you know, whether that is the actual growth rate for the first quarter until we get those data. So we’re managing policy in a much more live, real time way, and there, there are some things that suggest that growth may be moderating. For example, as I mentioned, some indicators of spending have shown a decline. The labor market indicators that I mentioned showed a slowing in the pace of growth. Some measures of business confidence are down. And also, there’s the pandemic. There’s the virus running its course. So, those are coming down to the level, or even below, more of a longer run sustainable level. So, we’re watching all of those, and that’s why I said that the economy may be slowing, but we don’t actually know that yet. We want to see much more data to have to be more confident in that assessment.

So we have to and we will, of course, use our tools to achieve our goals, and our goals are maximum employment and price stability. So, in the case of the Fed, it’s trying to balance those two things. We want to avoid the mistake of doing too much or too little. And, you know, that’s what we’re trying to do. That’s why we’ve, we’ve slowed the pace of asset purchases. And that’s why we’re watching so carefully now. We’re not making decisions about rate increases. We’re just watching the data to understand the trajectory of the economy and the implications for our policy.

So, I’ll I’ll start by, by talking about growth, and then I’ll get to the other question. So, you know, growth is going to depend on lots and lots of things, and, you know, we don’t have a model that can predict growth that way. We just have to be open to what comes in. There are there are factors that would tend to wind up pushing growth up in the direction of a full percentage point higher than we thought, but there are also factors that would tend to, to work in the other direction. So you’re going to get to, to a net number, and we just have to wait and see. I mean, another way to think about it is, we didn’t know about the virus at all a year ago. And then, when we knew, we understood that it would suppress economic activity. It did that, but, in a way, much less than we thought. So we just don’t have a lot of confidence in our ability to predict. That’s why our policy is highly data dependent. In terms of, of spending, so there are a couple things I would point out. You have a very high savings rate. You had, you had people at the lower end of the income spectrum, many who’d never had unemployment benefits, never had stimulus checks. They got all that, and they spent it. And it’s money that they spent that they, that they had saved. So that’s going to support spending. In addition, there are things like the rebates from new cars that people bought who were unable to buy them because there were no semiconductors. They’re getting those rebates now. That’s going to support spending. There are things like that. So, you know, the question is, where will it come from? It could come from, from savings. It could come from people who are getting vaccinated and going back to work and, and new jobs and, and that sort of thing. It’s also going to depend on how long this COVID strain runs for. The more time it takes to run its course, the longer it will suppress spending and growth and hiring.

So I would start by saying, if the economy follows that path, then our policy will follow. Of course, our policy is supposed to be conditioned on the economy. But what we’re saying is we’re watching carefully to see to make a judgment. And, and if the economy does follow that path, then our policy will reflect that path. I don’t want to be more specific than that, because you know we’re just now coming to the end of our meeting, and we want to be able to see more data before we make policy judgments.

So we’ve said that we wouldn’t just look at one or two months of labor market data. We would look at a broader range of data. What we’re seeing now is, is labor market data that’s still very strong. You’re still seeing very high job creation. You’re still seeing very high entrants into the labor force for example, by people retiring and, and going back to work. And you’re seeing wages moving up. The level of wages is very high in, in historical terms. So the labor market is still very strong. We’re not looking at a pretty rapid decline in the labor market. We’re not seeing that. We’re seeing very strong data still. So that’s why we’re watching carefully. We’re not we’re not looking at, at signs that the labor market is, is deteriorating at an alarming rate or anything like that. It’s still very strong. It’s just it’s just that it’s slowing a bit from the very high levels we saw a few months back.

I’m not going to I’m not going to try to define or prescribe. We’re not going to try to define with any precision what we mean by “moderate.” You know, it’s “moderate.” It has a, a common, you know, common  sense meaning. So, you know, I can’t be any more precise than that. So, you know, what are we going to be looking at? You know, we’re going to be looking at the path of the economy. We’re going to be looking at the implications for our for our goals. And then we’re also going to be looking at the appropriate stance of policy that, that, that follows from that.

No, the idea is, is that once we make that decision, we would then move to a more neutral stance. And that process should take some time. In fact, that process will take time, right? It takes it takes several meetings to, to do that. And so it’s just a way of thinking about it that says we’re not just going to come in and, and, you know, make a beeline for neutral. We’re going to do that over a period of meetings. So that’s what that’s what we’re thinking about.

So, in terms of the, the guidance, what we’ve said is that we’ll continue to add asset purchases each month until we get to our goal, and then we’ve, we’ve left it open as to what that process might look like. Some of you may have seen today’s Beige Book, and I would say that the overall impression from both the Beige Book and our Summary of Economic Projections is that the economy is, is performing well and is on track to, to make further progress toward our goals over the course of this year. We do note in both the Beige Book and the SEP that the unusually high growth numbers from last year are likely to mean that the growth this year, while still likely to be strong, will be moderated relative to that unusually high pace. And, of course, as I mentioned,
