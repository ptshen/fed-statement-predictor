Sure. I’ll simulate a Federal Reserve Chair’s press conference in a hypothetical scenario. Let me begin by setting the stage: Let’s imagine it’s early 2026, and the U.S. economy has posted strong growth, resilient employment, and inflation that has moved back down toward 2 percent over the past year. The Fed has been carefully evaluating this progress and the associated risks to the outlook. Here is how that press conference might go.

[Press Conference Begins]

So, as my colleagues on the FOMC and I have discussed publicly on several occasions, we’ve been focused on determining the extent to which the recent strong economic performance is sustaining progress toward our 2 percent inflation goal while also maintaining a strong labor market. The economic data arriving over the past year have been particularly favorable, and today we decided to lower our policy interest rate by ¼ percentage point, bringing the target range down to 3¾ to 4 percent. The Committee continues to anticipate that elevated inflation will continue to decline toward our 2 percent goal, that the labor market will remain strong, and that moderate economic growth will continue. In light of these expectations and the balance of risks, the Committee judges that it will be appropriate to lower our policy rate gradually. We’re committed to reaching a level of the federal funds rate that’s a bit below the longer run neutral rate, a stance of policy that we judge to be modestly accommodative and well suited to support continuing progress toward our inflation and employment goals. Let me step back and review how we got here and what the implications are for today’s policy decision. Over the past year, the U.S. economy has exhibited strong growth, with real GDP rising at 2.9 percent, bolstered by strong consumer demand as well as improving supply conditions. The labor market has remained strong, with job gains running near their pace of last year, the unemployment rate remaining low at 3.8 percent, and wages continuing to rise, albeit at a more sustainable pace than seen in 2023 and ’24. The economy has been resilient to higher interest rates and continues to perform well in this challenging macroeconomic environment. As shown in our Summary of Economic Projections, FOMC participants have raised their growth projections over the past year, and, as a result, the median projection for core and headline inflation has been revised down to 2.3 percent for this year and 2.1 percent next year, still above our 2 percent longer run goal. Participants expect inflation to run somewhat above 2 percent over the next couple of years before coming down to our target. Why the more favorable outlook? As we’ve noted many times, the recent strong performance reflects both a continued favorable shift in supply conditions and resilient demand. Inflationary pressures have receded significantly over the past year, particularly for goods, and to a lesser extent for housing services and other components. Surveys of consumers, businesses, and professional forecasters continue to show elevated readings of inflation expectations, however, and that warrants our close attention. We will continue to watch both market based and survey based measures of inflation expectations very carefully. In our projections, the median unemployment rate remains below 4 percent over the projection period and is judged to be consistent with maximum employment under our framework. If the economy continues to evolve broadly as expected, the median participant projects the longer run neutral rate to have risen by ¼ percentage point since June to 3.7 percent. Of course, the longer run neutral rate is not directly observable and must be inferred from asset prices and other variables, and it also evolves over time within a particular economic environment. So, the changes we’re seeing should be taken with a grain of salt. But what’s clear is that, in the current environment, FOMC participants generally judge that a modestly accommodative policy stance will be appropriate for some time, as we have said. Specifically, participants project the appropriate level of our policy rate to be 3.4 to 3.6 percent at the end of this year and 3.2 to 3.4 percent at the end of next year, a little higher than projected in June. Of course, these projections do not represent a Committee decision or plan, and no one knows with any certainty where the economy will be a year from now. In light of the favorable developments on inflation and the labor market, along with continued strong growth, the Committee judged that the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals are more balanced than they were a year ago. We therefore judged it appropriate today to take another step in lowering the target range for our policy rate. As I noted, with today’s action, the target range is 3¾ to 4 percent, and we continue to anticipate that, with continued progress on inflation while maintaining a strong job market, it will be appropriate to lower the policy rate gradually toward levels a bit below the longer run neutral rate. In our meeting today, we also received an overview of the findings of the Fed’s year  end stress tests of the largest financial institutions. Overall, the results show that the institutions are well capitalized and are resilient to the severe economic and financial conditions the tests assume. These tests play an important role in promoting the resilience of the largest financial institutions and the financial system overall. This year’s stress tests were notable for two developments. First, for the first time, the tests included a separate set of severe scenarios tailored to the specific business models of individual firms. Second, we included climate related shocks alongside the standard economic and financial shocks. The results under the tailored climate scenarios were mixed. For some institutions, losses under the climate scenarios were economically meaningful relative to their capital buffers; for others, they were not. This reflects the relatively early stage of understanding about the potential macroeconomic and financial effects of climate change. We’ll be carefully reviewing the results, and we’ll be assessing what additional steps we might take. We also continue to work on regulatory issues, including the implementation of Basel III Endgame, and we’re taking steps to further strengthen oversight and regulation of bank holding companies and their nonbank affiliates. The Fed has responsibility for these duties, and we remain fully committed to carrying them out. To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our goals: maximum employment and price stability. Thank you. I’m happy to take your questions.

Sure. So, what’s happened over the past year, really, is that inflation has continued to come down. If you go back to June of last year, the median projection for 2025 core PCE inflation was 2.8 percent. It’s now down to 2.3 percent. So that’s 5/10 a better than expected, if anything. And that’s, that’s, that’s mostly for reasons I started to mention earlier. It’s, it’s really, really a story of a continued favorable shift in supply conditions, in addition to demand moderating a bit. So, you saw it in, in the services sector. You’re seeing it in housing services, where, you know, we were very uncertain whether there would be enough supply to work its way through the pipeline and, and, and, you know, eventually show through to, to market rates that are, are related to, to rental rates. And we’re seeing that now. We’re seeing it in nonhousing services, too, where there’s just been better supply conditions. And we’re seeing it, and we saw it even more in goods. You know, goods inflation was very much a story of supply chains. And, and, you know, we had, we had thought that that story was basically told by the time of our June meeting. But, in fact, there’s been more to it than that. And we’re, we’re seeing ongoing, ongoing, ongoing declines in goods inflation, which, frankly, were not expected. So we’re, we’re, we’re pleased. We’re seeing these things. But we’re also very mindful that we need to be careful not to be overconfident and that we, we, we do expect inflation to run somewhat above 2 percent over the next couple of years, and, you know, we’re, we’re going to be watching it very carefully.

So, if you look at the, you know, the Summary of Economic Projections, people generally have their, their growths have gone up, their, their inflation readings have gone down, and they’re more confident in getting to 2 percent. And so, in that world, it’s not surprising that people would raise their estimate of the neutral rate because, you know, you’re looking at, at what’s happening with the economy, and, and you’re saying, “What would the neutral rate be in this new world?” Of course, as I pointed out, we also do know that these are, you know, these are estimates that are surrounded by high uncertainty and that they can move around. But, you know, that’s what happens when, when you have a better you have a better you have better prospects for inflation and for growth.

I think you’re looking at it right. We, we expect, and the public generally expects, I think, that we’ll continue to make progress toward 2 percent, but that inflation will run a little bit above 2 percent for a couple of years. And that’s, that’s what we’re, we’re expecting. And, you know, we’ll, we’ll be, as you know, we’ll be watching it very carefully. We have the ability we have the tools to move interest rates around to help make sure that that doesn’t happen. We don’t want inflation to run persistently above 2 percent. But that’s not what we’re expecting, and that’s not what our projection shows.

So, if you look at the Statement of Longer Run Principles
