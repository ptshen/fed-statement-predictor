I’m not going to be able to give you a new forecast today or update one, but I will say this. We’ve just come through a period of, of very sharp and rapid increases in inflation. We’ve seen inflation move up from near zero, essentially, to today, where it’s at 4 percent for the core and 6 percent on the headline let’s remember, headline includes energy and food, which are very volatile let’s remember, that’s including energy and food, and even there, it’s 6 percent. So that’s a significant increase. And that’s, that’s happening against a very different backdrop. For a long time, we’d been struggling with weak demand, and now we have a situation where demand is very strong. Very strong. And so if you have a situation where demand is very strong and supply is weak, you’re going to see, you know, upward pressure on prices. And that’s what we’re that’s what we’ve seen to a significant extent. We also see some evidence that the supply side is coming back, and we’re encouraged by that. But that’s, that’s what we see out there. We’re, we’re watching very carefully to see, to see how that works out. But our, our job is really to make sure that what can happen is that that inflation core inflation gets down to a lower, you know, more sustainable level, and we think we have the tools to do that.

Thanks. So I guess I’d start by saying, you know, that our policy, of course, is focused on our dual mandate, which is maximum employment and price stability. And we think that our current policy stance is the appropriate one to promote those two ends. We think that our policy stance supports a strong labor market, and we think it is setting up well to address the inflation issue that we have. So that’s, that’s where our policy is. If you ask about other financial conditions, you know, we many analysts look at a range of financial conditions, and, and they’ll say there are that financial conditions overall have tightened since the fall. And that’s right. You can see that. But, but if you look at, at more important financial conditions, like those that relate to the housing market, you’ll see that they have moved in a different direction, that they’ve actually eased, let’s say, in the housing market. The housing market has come off of its very high levels of last summer. If you look at the labor market, you know, we see strong demand for workers, we see wages moving up, we see job creation. It’s a very strong labor market, and it is some part, I’m sure, reflecting easy financial conditions. But, nonetheless, it’s, it’s a good labor market. It’s a strong labor market. I guess I’d also say that, you know, we think our policy is well positioned. We think the policy stance we’ve adopted is well positioned to address the risks and opportunities that we face in pursuing both sides of our mandate.

So what I said was, we’re prepared to speed up or slow down the taper if that becomes appropriate. And I was thinking mainly of situations in which the economy would, would be either stronger or weaker than expected. And if the economy is weaker than expected, then the taper is, is less needed, and maybe we’d want to speed it up. Conversely, if the economy is stronger, we might we might slow it down a little bit. We might also, another thing that could cause us to speed up or slow down would be inflation. If inflation, if we saw a longer run inflation issue, we might address that through, through the taper, because the taper is, is really setting up the runway for us for raising interest rates. And that’s, that’s where we would do that. Now, we’re not looking at that right now. We’re not looking at that at all. We’re, we’re very focused on the taper and setting up the runway and getting ready to, to raise interest rates. And we think we’re, we’re doing all those things just about the right way. But that’s the kind of thing I was thinking of. I’m not looking at that right now, though. I’m not saying, “I’m looking at that right now.” I’m saying, you know, if if something happens, if the economy behaves in a way that causes us to want to speed up or slow down the taper, we would do that.

So we’re, we’re well aware that the economy has, has evolved quite a lot since, you know, since we began the taper, and I would say that the economy is, is stronger now than we thought, as I think other forecasters have also concluded. So and, and, you know, we’re, we’re watching to see how that goes. And, you know, we’re prepared to adjust our taper, as I as I just described. We’re, we’re also going to watch to see how the supply side heals. That’s another big factor, is, is supply sorry, is the healing process for the supply side. And we’re going to watch that and, and hope that it goes well, and it does appear to be going well for now, but we’re going to watch it carefully too.

So I think the asset purchases are a very important tool. They’re brand new. They’re, they’re relatively, you know, not understood to be not understood very well at all. And they’re just going to be a permanent feature of our toolkit. We’re going to need to understand them. We need to know how they work. And we’re just beginning that project. In the meantime, they’ve done a great job. You can see that they’ve, they’ve moved financial conditions around and, and supported economic activity. So I think they’re, they’re a really important piece of, of our toolkit. I think the rate taper is a separate thing. I think we know how to do that. And we’re, we’re doing it about as well as we can do it right now.

I don’t think we’re at that stage. I think we’re, we’re just we’re at the stage where we’re, we’re continuing the process. And, you know, we’ll, we’ll finish it, and then we’ll turn to the next thing. And we’ll do that. I don’t think we’re, we’re now in a world where we’re, you know, doing those at the same time. I think we’ll do one, and then we’ll turn to the other. And, and we’re just we’re just at the beginning of the first of those, I’d say.

So, on the first question, you know, I think we’re at a place where inflation is higher than, than we’d like it to be. We think that, that the economy is coming out of the pandemic stronger than we thought. We see very strong demand, and we see the beginnings of supply side healing. And we think that’s, that’s going to continue. And we think that, over time, that will help bring inflation down. So that’s, that’s right now where we are. We’re focused on the taper, and on setting up the runway, and then we’ll be coming to interest rates fairly soon. And, you know, we’re, we’re at the beginning of that process. So that’s how I think about that. Your second question was ?

So we’re, we’re just at the beginning of that process, and, and we’re going to be watching carefully. We’re going to be looking to see, you know, as I mentioned, as the economy heals further, and as the supply side heals further, as demand settles down, we’re going to be watching inflation, and we’re going to be watching labor market demand. We’re going to be watching those things. And we’re going to be asking ourselves, “Are we on track here?” You know, what, what do we need to do? And remember that we can do those things. We can speed up or slow down the taper, if it becomes appropriate, as I mentioned. So I don’t I don’t want to put a time on it, because I, I don’t want to put a time on it, because we don’t really know. We’re going to need to see, you know, how this unfolds. The other thing I’ll say is, there are many, many factors that affect, you know, the timing of rate increases, and they’re not just inflation. There are many other factors that will go into that decision when the time comes. But that’s, that’s how I think about it.

So, you know, you’re right. The asset purchases are, are a very different thing. And, you know, the decision was to taper them three months sooner than expected. And, and that’s and that’s a decision that we, that we made. We also, you know, we raised growth forecasts and, and, I think, inflation forecasts as well. And we think that’s kind of what’s happening out there. We also think that the, the economy will continue to be strong. We’re, we’re getting, you know, robust GDP readings coming in. We’re getting strong labor market readings. So we’re, we’re seeing a strong economy. And we’re also seeing the, the beginnings of supply side healing. And we think that’ll continue. And we think that’ll help bring inflation down. So that’s, that’s how we think about it. And, by the way, we’re not just assuming that the supply side will heal. We’re going to be watching it carefully and, and we’re prepared to use our tools to help that process. We’re not going to have to do that, we hope, but we’re prepared to do
