Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome. I will begin with an overview of economic conditions and an explanation of the decisions the Committee made at today’s meeting. My colleagues and I have one overarching goal: to sustain the economic expansion, with a strong job market and stable prices, for the benefit of the American people. The U.S. economy is in a good place, and we will continue to use our monetary policy tools to help keep it there. The jobs market is strong, showing healthier wage gains and prompting many people to join or remain in the workforce. The unemployment rate is near historic lows, and inflation remains near our 2 percent goal. We continue to expect that the American economy will grow at a solid pace in 2019, although likely slower than the very strong pace of 2018. We believe that our current policy stance is appropriate. Since last year, however, we have noted some developments at home and around the world that bear close attention. Given the overall favorable conditions in our economy, my colleagues and I will be patient in assessing what, if any, changes in the stance of policy may be needed. Let me explain in more detail how incoming data warrant our current stance and a wait and see approach to changes. With the benefit of fiscal stimulus and other tailwinds, growth in 2018 was strong in fact, at 3.1 percent, the strongest year in more than a decade. For some time, most forecasts have called for growth to continue in 2019 at a somewhat lower but still healthy pace. For example, last September, Committee participants saw growth coming in at about 2.5 percent this year. Data arriving since September suggest that growth is slowing somewhat more than expected. Financial conditions tightened considerably over the fourth quarter. While conditions have eased since then, they remain less supportive of growth than during most of 2018. Growth has slowed in some foreign economies notably, in Europe and China. While the U.S. economy showed little evidence of slowdown through the end of 2018, the limited data we have so far this year have been somewhat more mixed. Unusually strong payroll job growth in January was followed by little growth at all in February. Smoothing through these variations, average monthly job growth appears to have stepped down from last year’s strong pace, but job gains remain well above the pace necessary to provide jobs for new labor force entrants. Many other labor market indicators continue to show strength. Weak retail sales data for December bounced back considerably in January but, on balance, seem to point to somewhat slower growth in consumer spending. Business fixed investment also appears to be growing at a slower pace than last year. Inflation has been muted, and some indicators of longer term inflation expectations remain at the low end of their ranges in recent years. Along with these developments, unresolved policy issues, such as Brexit and the ongoing trade negotiations, pose some risks to the outlook. Much of the discussion at our meeting focused on what we should make of the varied indicators. Today’s Summary of Economic Projections, the SEP, reflects the assessments of individual Committee participants. And these views are in line with a broad range of other forecasts and point to a modest slowdown, with overall conditions remaining favorable. FOMC participants sought now see 2019 growth at roughly 2 percent, with the unemployment rate remaining below 4 percent. Core inflation, which omits the effects of volatile food and energy prices, remains close to 2 percent. Declines in oil prices since last fall are expected to push headline inflation below 2 percent for a time, but this effect is likely to be temporary. Now, I’m describing views of the most likely outcomes, but historical experience reminds us that growth and inflation this year could be stronger or weaker than what we now project. The federal funds rate is now in the broad range of estimates of neutral the rate that tends neither to stimulate nor to restrain the economy. As I noted, my colleagues and I think that this setting is well suited to the current outlook and believe that we should be patient in assessing the need for any change in the stance of policy. “Patient” means that we see no need to rush to judgment. It may be some time before the outlook for jobs and inflation calls clearly for a change in policy. In discussing the Committee’s projections, it’s useful to note what those projections are, as well as what they are not. The SEP includes participants’ individual projections of the most likely economic scenario, along with their views of the appropriate path of the federal funds rate in that scenario. Views about the most likely scenario form one input into our policy discussions. We also discuss other plausible scenarios, including the risk of more worrisome outcomes. These and other scenarios and many other considerations go into policy but are not reflected in projections of the most likely case. Thus, we always emphasize that the interest rate projections in the SEP are not a Committee decision. They are not a Committee plan. As Chair Yellen noted some years ago, the FOMC statement, rather than the dot plot, is the device that the Committee uses to express its opinions about the likely path of rates. Today the Committee released Balance Sheet Normalization Principles and Plans  revised Balance Sheet Normalization Principles and Plans. We have long said that the size of the balance sheet will be considered normalized when the balance sheet is once again at the smallest level consistent with conducting monetary policy efficiently and effectively. We have sought to make the normalization process transparent, predictable, and gradual in order to minimize disruption and risks to our dual mandate objectives. Today’s announcement is the result of discussions over the past four FOMC meetings about how best to achieve these goals. The plans have many technical details, and I’ll be happy to answer questions on those details. But, for now, I’ll summarize the key elements. Since October 2017, we have been allowing our asset holdings to decline by not reinvesting all of the payments we receive as securities matured or were prepaid. Today we announced that we intend to slow the runoff of our assets starting in May and to cease runoff entirely in September of this year. In September, reserve balances may still be somewhat above the level required to conduct policy efficiently and effectively. If this is so, we may hold the size of our asset holdings roughly constant for a time. During this time, ongoing gradual increases in currency and our other nonreserve liabilities would imply very gradual declines in reserve balances. When the Committee judges that reserves should not decline further, securities holdings will again begin to rise, as dictated by the growth of demand for our reserve and nonreserve liabilities. We believe that these plans will facilitate a predictable, transparent, and smooth process, and we will make additional adjustments if conditions warrant. The Committee will soon turn to a few remaining normalization topics, including the desired maturity composition of our portfolio of Treasury securities. We maintain our long  stated intention to return to a portfolio consisting mainly of Treasury securities. Thank you. And I will be glad to take your questions.

So, on the outlook, our outlook is a positive one. So, as I mentioned, FOMC participants continue to see growth this year of around 2 percent, just a bit below what we saw back in at the end of last year. And part of that is seeing that economic fundamentals underlying economic fundamentals are still very strong. You have a strong labor market by most measures. You have rising incomes. You’ve got very low unemployment. You have confidence surveys for households and also for businesses that are at attractive levels, and you also have financial conditions that are more accommodative than they were a couple of months ago. So we see the outlook as a positive one. As far as balance sheet the balance sheet plan, the answer to that is, you asked whether that’s related to our monetary policy, in effect, and the answer is really “no.” We are we still  we think of the interest rate tool as the principal tool of monetary policy, and we think of ourselves as returning the balance sheet to a normal level over the course of the next six months. And we’re not really thinking of those as two different tools of monetary policy.

So the global economy was a tailwind for the United States in 2017. That was the year of synchronized global growth. And we began 2018 expecting and hoping for more of the same. What happened instead is that the global economy started to gradually slow, and now we see a situation where the European economy has slowed substantially and so has the Chinese economy, although the European economy more. And just as strong global growth was a tailwind, weaker global growth can be a headwind to our economy. How big is that effect? It’s hard to be precise about it, but, clearly, we will feel that. It is an integrated global economy, and global financial markets are integrated as well. In terms of what’s causing it, it seems to be a range of different things. In China, you have, you know, factors that are very specific to China. The main point, though, is that, I would say, the outlook let’s look at the outlook. Chinese authorities have taken many steps since the middle of last year to support economic activity, and I think the base case is that, ultimately, Chinese activity will stabilize at an attractive level. And in Europe, you know, we see some weakening, but, again, we don’t see we don’t see recession, and we do see positive growth still. You ask about tariffs. I would say, tariffs may be a factor in China. I don’t think they’re the main factor. I think the main factors are the delevering campaign that the government undertook a couple of years ago and also just the longer term slowing to a more sustainable pace of growth that economies find as they mature. In terms of our own economy, the level of tariffs is relatively small in the size of our economy relative to the size of our economy. We have, since the beginning of the year and before, really been hearing from our extensive network of business contacts a lot of concerns about tariffs, concerns about material costs on imported products, and the loss of markets and things like that, depending on which industry, so there’s a fair amount of uncertainty. It’s hard to say how much of an effect that’s having on our economy. It’s very hard to tease that apart. But I will say, it’s been a prominent concern among our business contacts for some time now.

Wells Fargo. So what happened at Wells Fargo really was a remarkably widespread series of breakdowns, really, in their risk management apparatus, which resulted in significant consumer abuses, let’s say. And as it’s gone on and on, it’s become clear that I think some time ago it became clear that these are deep problems that needed to be addressed in a fundamental kind of a way. So there’s a lot of work to do on that. And we put in place, really, an unprecedented sanction in the form of an asset growth cap, and we will not lift that until Wells Fargo gets their arms around this, comes forward with plans, implements those plans, and we’re satisfied with what they’ve done. And that’s not where we are right now.

You know, our main supervisory focus is on the company fixing its risk management approach and fundamentally rebuilding that approach. We don’t approve individual pay packages. We do supervise boards of directors for, you know, for having a set of compensation practices that don’t reward short term risk taking and that sort of thing. And we will supervise based on that.

Well, first, the data are not currently sending a signal that we need to move in one direction or another, in my view. I would say it this way: We see a positive outlook for this year, a favorable outlook for this year, as I mentioned. So, in our SEP projections, Committee members, participants, generally see growth of around 2 percent. They see unemployment remaining below 4 percent. They see inflation remaining close to target. And they see growth, as I said, around 2 percent. So, you know, that’s a positive outlook. It’s a favorable outlook. We’re also very mindful and we have been, of course, all along of what the risks are. And you see you mentioned some of them. You know, you see slowing global growth. You still have there’s no resolution of Brexit. There’s no resolution, really, of the trade talks. These are ongoing risks. We’re also carefully monitoring what’s happening with

I haven’t I haven’t seen their projection. I wouldn’t comment on their projection. I would take it this way. You can think of growth as being composed of two things. And one is really growth in the workforce more hours worked. And the other is productivity it’s output per hour. You can really think of growth as those two things. And I’ve been calling often mentioning these days that it would be great if we had national level policies to support higher labor force participation. The United States is now one of the lowest countries among the advanced economies, in terms of our labor force participation by prime age workers. And that’s a place where we can grow faster. If we can bring more people into the labor force and give them a chance to contribute to and benefit from our overall prosperity, that will be a great thing for the country. So I would like to see that. Productivity is much harder. It’s very difficult to project productivity over long stretches of time. It’s a function of evolving technology. So, I guess I would say, what is the potential growth rate? It’s quite hard to know with any precision, and I just would like to see us, you know, undertake an effort to make it be as high as it can sustainably be.

I would say so. I think it’s clear that the tax and spending policies that were adopted early last year supported demand in a significant way last year. And it’s also the case, I think, that they should have some supply side effects. I think it’s hard to know, it’s hard to identify those with any precision, and we hope they’re we hope they’re very large. You know, the idea would be that lowering corporate taxes would spur more corporate investment, which would spur more productivity, and lowering individual taxes would spur greater labor force participation. I wouldn’t want to be handing you know, assigning credit or blame for that, but I do think that the performance of labor force participation over the last, really, three or four years has been an upside surprise that most people didn’t see coming, and it’s extremely welcome.

As I mentioned, the data that we’re seeing are not currently sending a signal which suggests moving in either direction for me, which is really why we’re being patient. We feel our policy rate is in the range of neutral. The economy is growing at about trend. Inflation is close to target. Unemployment is under 3 percent.1 It’s a great time for us to be patient and watch and wait and see how things evolve.

So you mentioned the qualitative aspect of CCAR. And U.S. the large U.S. financial institutions have made significant progress there and are now much better at the capital planning process. And for, really, some time now, for a couple of years, we’ve talked about moving supervision of that process moving to a supervisory approach to that rather than having a pass/fail in the stress tests. We’ve been talking about that for quite a while. And I think, given the level that the banks have moved to in capital planning, we did that. It shouldn’t be a big surprise something we’ve been talking about doing for a couple of years. For banks that are newer to CCAR and haven’t made that kind of progress, then they’re still going to be part of they’re still going to have a qualitative test until they can reach similar levels of achievement. In terms of having disparate views, I look, we try we are very much a consensus  driven organization. We try very hard to reach consensus on things. In the end, it’s very healthy to have disparate views and to state them publicly and put them on the record. It’s nothing but healthy from my standpoint. We’ll always be trying to reach consensus, and, you know, I’m committed to that.

So on the household side, what we saw was a very weak reading on retail sales in December and then a bounceback in the January reading. And, you know, it was a surprise, I would say, and inconsistent with a significant amount of other data. We’re not dismissing it in any way, but I would go back to, what is it that supports consumer spending? It’s 70 percent of the economy, as you point out. It’s strong economic underlying fundamentals, so, rising wages, high levels of employment, low levels of unemployment, high levels of job creation, confidence. The household confidence surveys have moved back up to where they were last summer. So we look at those fundamentals, and we think that looks like a setting in which consumption will have support from underlying economic fundamentals. And that’s really what we’re thinking there. So, you know, we’re also patiently watching and waiting and not assuming. We’re not taking no signal from the incoming data; that’s why we called it out in our statement. So I think our eyes are open on this.

We’re in a very different world today and post crisis, because we now very carefully monitor financial conditions and financial stability concerns on an ongoing basis, and we publish a report twice a year, and we have quarterly Board meetings and briefings where we look deeply into these things. So this is something we have very much on our radar screen. And I would say, overall, we don’t see financial stability vulnerabilities as high. There are some aspects of the financial markets that we’re carefully monitoring, and those are in the nature of things that might be amplifiers to a downturn as opposed to a financial stability concern, which might lead to a financial crisis and that kind of thing, which we don’t see. So we do monitor that. And I would also say, you know, that the whole question of monetary policy and financial stability is an unsettled and difficult one in our world. We do think that the principal tools for, you know, for managing financial stability are regulation, supervision, macroprudential tools, and those sorts of things as opposed to changing the interest rate. But we’re certainly very mindful of financial conditions and those risks.

It’s a very difficult question with a long answer. We in our system, we mainly rely on “through the cycle” tools like high capital and stress tests. Our financial stability system is built on those tools: high capital, high liquidity, resolution planning, stress testing. So those are always on. We also have some tools, like the countercyclical capital buffer, which we can deploy at times when vulnerabilities are meaningfully above normal. But we do rely on those tools. And I would say, our banks are well capitalized. They’re far better capitalized and better aware of their risks and more liquid than they were before the financial crisis. So they’ll be more resilient in, you know, in difficult states of the economy.

I do think that deficits matter, and I do think I think it’s not really controversial to say that our debt can’t grow faster than our economy indefinitely and that’s what it’s doing now. So this is something we will have to deal with, and I think we can’t really lose sight of that, and I’d like to see a greater focus on that over time. It’s not in the nature of a near  term debt crisis or anything like that, and I wouldn’t want to try to predict when that would happen, but it is something that it’s important that the public discussion really come back to, if I can say that. And we will have to deal with it eventually.

So, of course, we’re watching Brexit carefully and hoping that it can be resolved in an orderly way. From our standpoint, the part of it that we can control is that we’ve been involved with supervising our financial institutions that are active either in the United Kingdom or the European Union or both to make sure that they’re ready for the full range of possible outcomes to the to Brexit. So and in doing so, we’ve also had we’ve also worked alongside regulators from the United Kingdom and the EU. So we do, again, hope that that can be resolved well, but we know that our banks are well capitalized and resilient to different kinds of events. In terms of the size of the balance sheet, the balance sheet will be of a size of approximately 17 percent of GDP around the end of this year, down from 25 percent of GDP at the end of 2014 so, significantly smaller relative to GDP than it was. I’m guessing you’re looking for a dollar number, though, probably, and that would be so, for the size of the balance sheet, it looks like it’ll be a bit above $3.5 trillion then.

Let me take wages first, if I can. So wages have moved up in the last couple of years and are now running at healthier, higher levels, and that’s a good thing. In fact, a lot of the wage gains have been going to lower paid workers, as can happen late in the cycle, which is also a good thing. So but that’s not price inflation, that’s wage inflation. Our mandate, sorry, is price inflation. So what I see is inflation that’s close to 2 percent but that sort of keeps bumping up against 2 percent and then maybe moving back down a little bit. And I don’t feel that we have kind of convincingly achieved our 2 percent mandate in a symmetrical way. Now, what do we mean by “symmetrical”? What we really mean is that we would look at we know that inflation will move around on both sides of the target, and what we say is that we would be equally concerned with inflation persistently above as persistently below the target. So that’s really our framework. And I don’t think we’ve quite achieved that yet, because we’re really 10 years deep in this almost 10 years in this expansion, and inflation is still kind of, I’d say, not, you know, clearly meeting our target. So that’s one of the reasons why we’re being patient. I think, as I’ve said before, I think inflation that is a little bit below our target  particularly headline inflation this year will be, you know, meaningfully below our target for most of the year because of lower oil prices, but we project that core will be too that gives us the ability to be patient and not move until we see that our target goals are being achieved.

It’s a major challenge. It’s one of the major challenges of our time, really, to have inflation you know, downward pressure on inflation, let’s say. It gives central banks less room to, you know, to respond to downturns, right? So if inflation expectations are below 2 percent, they’re always going to be pulling inflation down, and we’re going to be paddling upstream in trying to, you know, keep inflation at 2 percent, which gives us some room to cut, you know, when it’s time to cut rates when the economy weakens. And, you know, that’s something that central banks face all over the world, and we certainly face that problem too. It’s one of the one of the things we’re looking into as part of our strategic monetary policy review this year. The proximity to the zero lower bound calls for more creative thinking about ways we can, you know, uphold the credibility of our inflation target, and, you know, we’re open minded about ways we can do that.

Well, we I think we were we wanted to be careful to go ahead and acknowledge the things. I think it’s relatively little hard data so far this year, but we were careful to point out lower retail sales the weak November meeting BFI, all those things, and I think that was the right thing to do.2 Notwithstanding that, we do have a positive outlook for the year for the reasons I mentioned you know, solid underlying economic fundamentals, et cetera. So, and in terms of what it would take, I’d say, again, today we don’t see any we don’t see data coming in that suggests that we should move in either direction. They suggest that we should remain patient and let the situation clarify itself over time. When the time comes, we’ll act appropriately.

Well, let me say that we’ve had, you know, a significant move up in wages and compensation over the last few years, and I which does not trouble me from the standpoint of inflation. We’ve had also had in other cycles, we’ve had situations where, you know, unit labor costs were moving up above inflation, and that didn’t lead to price inflation. It does you know, in theory, it can squeeze corporate margins, and, you know, that can’t go on indefinitely. But, nonetheless, I don’t see the current wage picture as concerning from an inflation standpoint.

I don’t think we look at I understand what you’re asking, but we’re looking at our mandate is price inflation and maximum employment, and that’s what we’re looking at with setting interest rates. And we also monitor financial stability very carefully across all meaningful asset categories. I don’t think we tie it particularly to the relationship you’re talking about.

Well, as I mentioned, you know, with the stress tests that the largest financial institutions and those are the ones that tend to be active internationally that they undergo every year, we put them through very large financial shocks with large losses and big changes in markets every year. And we vary that every year. So that’s a pretty good you know, having done that for a number of years now, that’s and having them be required to have adequate capital and liquidity even after all that happens. So that’s a good thing to have done, knowing that you’re going into something that’s quite unknown, which may prove stressful, it may not prove stressful, depending on what the outcome is. So I think all that has probably prepared our institutions well. That said, nothing like this has happened in recent years, and so it’s really hard to be confident. So we’re very watchful about what’s going on.

So we don’t you know, we the dollar is really the business of the Treasury Department. It’s certainly a financial condition unto itself that plays into our models, but we don’t, you know, seek or model or attempt to affect the dollar directly with our policies.

So we take we take fiscal policy as, you know, as exogenous to what we do. You know, in other words, whatever happens with fiscal policy, we take that. We don’t evaluate it, we don’t criticize it, and we don’t overreact to it either. So I think it’s just a fact. It’s just an external fact about the economy for us. I mean, our policy is the reason we’re on hold is that we think our policy rate is in a good place, and we think the economy is in a good place, and we’re watching carefully as we see these events evolve around the world and at home, and we think that’s what we need to be doing.

The basic answer to your question is “no.” We are the decision about the maturity composition of the Fed’s balance sheet in the longer run lies ahead of us. We have not made that decision, and we’re we really haven’t begun to have a serious series of discussions over a series of meetings to grapple with that. That, I think, will be something we turn to reasonably soon, but I think it will take some time. It’s a consequential decision and one that needs some thought. We’ve had a lot of balance sheet discussions, as I mentioned, over the last four meetings, but this is the next big one that big decision that we’ll face. And, you know, I think we’re not going to be in a rush to resolve it, but we’ll turn to it soon.

I think, isn’t it just that as securities roll off, you wind up investing in you know, as a 10 year rolls off, you wind up investing in a 10 year, and automatically that lengthens things. It’s not at all a plan to lengthen the balance sheet. It’s just been we try to have a practice that we don’t deviate from, and it’s transparent, and no policy message in that.

So, as I as I mentioned, the balance sheet runoff will stop at about at September 30. And if it is our view at that time that we’re still a ways away from a ways above a balance sheet that is what we need to efficiently and effectively conduct monetary policy, at that time we will hold the balance sheet constant. And then what’ll happen is, organically, very gradually, currency and other nonreserved liabilities will grow, and reserves will shrink. And the question you’re asking is, how long will that go on? The truth is, we don’t know, and we don’t really know that we’ll move past September 30th. The level of reserve demand is something that we’ve put a lot of effort and time into creating estimates, based on market intelligence and surveys and that kind of thing. The truth is, we don’t know. It may evolve over time. So we’ll just have to see. I wouldn’t want to put a time out there for that, but so I’ll just leave it there.

You know, I’m just going to say that I think we’re in a good place right now, which is, we’re being patient, we’re watching, we don’t see any data pushing us to move rates in either direction, and we’re going to watch carefully and patiently as we allow events to evolve. And when they do clarify, we will act appropriately.
