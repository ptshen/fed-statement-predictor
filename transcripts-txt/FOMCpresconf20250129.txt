Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on achieving our dual mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of the American people. The economy is strong is strong overall and has made significant progress toward our goals over the past two years. Labor market conditions have cooled from their formerly overheated state and remain solid. Inflation has moved much closer to our 2 percent longer run goal, though it remains somewhat elevated. In support of our goals, today the Federal Open Market Committee decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings. I’ll have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments. Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. For 2024 as a whole, GDP looks to have risen above 2 percent, bolstered by resilient consumer spending. Investment in equipment and intangibles appears to have slowed in the fourth quarter but was strong for the year overall. Following weakness in the middle of last year, activity in the housing sector seems to have stabilized. In the labor market, conditions remain solid. Payroll job gains averaged 170,000 per month over the past three months. Following earlier increases, the unemployment rate has stabilized since the middle of last year and, at 4.1 percent in December, remains low. Nominal wage growth has eased over the past year, and the jobs to workers gap has narrowed. Overall, a wide set of indicators suggests that conditions in the labor market are broadly in balance. The labor market is not a source of significant inflationary pressures. Inflation has eased significantly over the past two years but remains somewhat elevated relative to our 2 percent longer run goal. Estimates based on the consumer price index and other

data indicate that total PCE prices rose 2.6 percent over the 12 months ending in December and that, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.8 percent. Longer term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets. Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. We see the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals as being roughly in balance, and we are attentive to the risks on both sides of our mandate. Over the course of our three previous meetings, we lowered our policy rate by a full percentage point from its peak. That recalibration of our policy stance was appropriate in light of the progress on inflation and the rebalancing in the labor market. With our policy stance significantly less restrictive than it had been and the economy remaining strong, we do not need to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance. At today’s meeting, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4¼ to 4½ percent. We know that reducing policy restraint too fast or too much could hinder progress on inflation. At the same time, reducing policy restraint too slowly or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment. In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. We’re not on any preset course. As the economy evolves, we will adjust our policy stance in a manner that best promotes our maximum employment and price stability goals. If the economy remains economy remains strong and inflation does not continue to move sustainably toward 2 percent, we can

maintain policy restraint for longer. If the labor market were to weaken unexpectedly or inflation were to fall more quickly than anticipated, we can ease policy accordingly. Policy is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate. As we previously announced, our five year review, review of our monetary policy framework is taking place this year. At this meeting, the Committee began its discussions by reviewing the context and outcomes of our previous review that concluded in 2020 as well as the experiences of other central banks in conducting reviews. Our review will again include outreach and public events involving a wide range of parties, including Fed Listens events around the country and a research conference in May. Throughout this process, we will be open to new ideas and critical feedback, and we will take on board lessons of the last five years in determining our findings. We intend to wrap up the review by late summer. I would note that the Committee’s 2 percent longer run inflation goal will, will be retained and will not be a focus of the review. The Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy: maximum employment and stable prices. We remain committed to supporting maximum employment, bringing inflation sustainably to our 2 percent goal, and keeping longer run inflation expectations well anchored. Our success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans. We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals. Thank you. I look forward to your questions.

Three questions. I’m seeing, seeing it really as one question, though. So, I, I’m not going to have I’m not going to have any, any response or comment whatsoever on, on what the President’s said. It’s not appropriate for me to do so. The public should be confident that we will continue to do our work as we always have focusing on using our tools to achieve our goals, and really keeping our heads down and doing our work. And that’s how we best serve the public.

I’ve had no contact.

Thanks.

I don’t think that my assessment really has changed. I mean, a couple of things have happened. We’ve gotten more strong data, but we’ve also seen rates move up at the long end, which could represent a tightening in financial conditions. I think if we look back over the past year or so, we can see that policy is restrictive. If you look at the effect of high rates on interest sensitive spending for example, in housing and if you look at the achievement of our goal variables, we’re seeing the economy move toward 2 percent inflation and, and has moved largely to maximum employment, so. Though we literally look at the at the at movement toward the goal variables to make that assessment. Now, policy is meaningfully less restrictive than it was before we began to cut. It’s 100 basis points less restrictive. And for that reason, you know, we’re going to be focusing on seeing real progress on inflation or, alternatively, some weakness in the labor market before we before we consider making adjustments.

So, I, I think our policy stance is very well calibrated, as I mentioned, to balance the achievement of our two of our two goals. We, we want to policy to be restrictive enough to continue to foster further, further progress for our 2 percent inflation goal. At the same time, we don’t need to see further weakening in the labor market to achieve that goal, and that’s kind of what we’ve been getting. The labor market has really been broadly stable; the unemployment rate has been broadly stable now for six months. Conditions seem to be broadly in balance. And I would say, look at the last couple of inflation readings and you see we don’t we don’t overreact to two good readings or two bad readings. But, nonetheless, the

last couple of readings have suggested, you know, more positive readings. So I, I think we’re I think policy’s well, well positioned.

No, so let me look if you just look at the first paragraph, we did a little bit of language cleanup there. We took out a reference to “since earlier in the year” as it related to the labor market, and we just chose to, to shorten that sentence. Again, I, I mean, if you look at the sort of intermeeting data was good, and, and there was there was another inflation reading, I guess, just before the December meeting. So, we’ve got two, two good readings in a row that are consistent with 2 percent inflation. Again, we’re not going to overinterpret two good or two bad readings, but this was not meant to send a signal other than this: You know, you, you can take away from all of this that we remain committed to achieving our 2 percent inflation goal sustainably.

Well I, I’d say you, you see expectations moving up a little bit, at the short end but not at the longer run, which [is] where it really matters. And those could be related to could be related to what you mentioned, some of the new policies. I think where the

Committee is very much in the mode of waiting to see what policies are enacted. We, and we, we don’t know what will happen with, with tariffs, with immigration, with fiscal policy, and with regulatory policy. We’re only just beginning to see actually, are not really beginning to see much, and I think we need to we need to let those policies be articulated before we can even begin to make a, a plausible assessment of what their implications for the economy will be. So we’re going to be watching carefully and, and, as we always do. This is no different than any other set of policy changes at the beginning of a of an Administration. We’ll patiently watch and understand and, and, you know, kind of not be in a hurry to, to get to a place of understanding what our policy response should be until we see how it plays out.

Well, at all times at all times, forecasts are conditional, at a minimum, on just a set of expectations, and, and they’re highly uncertain in both directions. We, we know that economic forecasting is, is really difficult, beyond just a month or two out. So in the current situation, there’s probably some elevated uncertainty because of, of, you know, significant policy shifts in those four areas that I mentioned: tariffs, tariffs, immigration, fiscal policy, and, and regulatory policy. So there’s probably some additional uncertainty, but that should be passing; we should go through that. And then we’ll be back to the regular amount of

uncertain. You know, what, what forecasters are doing not just us, but everybody’s doing is they’ve got sort of just a set of assumptions about what might happen, but they’re really kind of in the nature of a placeholder, and meaning, you know, plausible, could be, but honestly you wouldn’t stand behind it because you just don’t know, and so you’re just you’re just on hold, waiting to see what comes down. You know, it’s, it’s a very large economy, and policies affect it at the margin, but we’ll, you know, we’re going to wait and see.

You know, we’re we’re looking it’s more the other the way  the way it works is, we are looking at the data to guide us in what we should do. And, you know, that, that’s what we do. And right now, we feel like we’re in a very good place. Policy’s well positioned. The economy’s in, in quite a good place, actually, as well. And what, what we do expect is to see further progress on inflation, and, you know, as I mentioned, as we see that or if we were to see weakening in the labor market that could foster we could then be in a position of, of making further adjustments. But, right now, we, we don’t see that, and we see things as in a really good place for policy and for the economy, and so we feel like we don’t need to be in a hurry to, to make any adjustments.

So let me say, “yes,” in answer to your first question. But, to the second question, I want to say this: We are, like others, we’re reviewing the orders and the associated details as they are made available. And as has been our practice over many Administrations, we are working to align our policies with the executive orders as appropriate and consistent with applicable law. And I want to add that I’m not going to have anything more specific for you today on this whole set of issues.

So I did I did mention “consistent with applicable law,” right?

You know, I’ve as I’ve said countless times over the years, this is this is who we are; this is what we do. We study the data, we, we analyze how it will affect the outlook and the balance of risks, and we use our tools to try to give it our best understanding,

our best thinking, try to achieve our goals. That’s what we do; that’s always what we do. Don’t look for us to do anything else. And that’s you know, lots of research shows that’s the that’s the best way for a central bank to operate. That’ll give us the best possible chance to achieve these goals for the benefit of the American people. That’s always what we’re going to do. And people should have confidence in that, as I as I said a few minutes ago.

So one of the things our, our staff does is they, they look at a range of possible outcomes, and, and they, they tend to go from really good to really bad, and, you know, it’s, it’s one of the best things that they do. And in each Tealbook you can look at the five year old Tealbooks and see their alternative simulations. So that’s what they do. They, it’ll be a baseline, and then they’ll show six or seven alternative scenarios, including really good ones and, and not so good ones. And what those do is they spark, you know, the, the policymakers to sort of think and understand about the, you know, the, the uncertainties that surround this. So, yes, we, we staff does that, and we, we’re all well aware that there are that the range of possibilities is always broad, and not just now, but always. And you have to it’s hard to be open to just how, how broad the possibilities are for an economy. You know, no one saw the pandemic coming, and it was you know, it changed everything. So things happen, and but yes, we do we do do that. But it’s, it’s one thing to do that to make assessments about what might happen and begin to think about what you might do in that case, but you don’t act until you until you see much more than we see now.

I’d say it’s the same. You know, we, we want to see, you know, further progress on inflation. And, you know, the story’s there. It’s, it’s we’re just going to have to see the data. At the end of the day, it, it comes down to 12 month inflation, because that takes out the seasonality issues that may exist. And, you know, we’re, we’re just going to need to see that. We think that we think we see the pathway for that to happen. One, one example a key example is that you now do see owner’s equivalent rent and, you know, housing services the way it’s calculated for PCE [prices], you see that coming down pretty steadily now, and that’s the that’s the place where the, most of the remaining gap is. In addition, a big part of the overrun, as you will know, was [coming] from nonmarket services [prices], which don’t tend to send much signal [about future inflation]. So you can look through all that and, and think, “Okay, that then we seem to be set up for further progress.” But being seem to set up for it is one thing; having it is another. So we, we’re going to want to see further, further progress on inflation. Remember, we’re not, you know, we’re, we’re under 2 percent, but our goal is 2 percent, and we do mean to get back sustainably to 2 percent.

So you’re right. I mean, we look at, of course, a very broad range. And, so, it starts with unemployment sorry, with, yeah, with the unemployment rate, employment participation, wages, job quits are people quitting? that kind of thing. The ratio of vacancies to unemployed. We look at all those things, and you, you put your finger, though, on it’s a low it’s a low hiring environment. So if you have a job, it’s all it’s all good, but if you if you have to find a job, the job finding rate the hiring rates have come down. And that’s, that’s more typical of a let’s say let’s say that the unemployment that the that the labor market is at a sustainable level. It’s not overheated anymore. We don’t think we need it to cool off anymore. We do watch it extremely carefully. It’s one of our two goal variables. But, yeah, I, I’d say we watch those things quite carefully. But nonetheless, overall, look at the aggregate data in the labor market. It does seem to the labor market does seem, seem to be pretty stable and broadly in balance. When you’ve got a, an unemployment rate that is that has been pretty stable now for, for a, a full half a year.

You know, so what’s happening is that the, the flows across the border have decreased very significantly, and there’s every reason to expect that to continue. And so but job creation has come down a bit, too, so, you know, if those two things come down together, that, that sort of can be a reason for the unemployment rate to stabilize. In other words, a breakeven rate as, as population growth slows, the breakeven rate that you need in new jobs to make to, to make jobs for, for workers declines as well. So that seems to be something about what’s happening. You, you do see a very a very flat unemployment rate at a time when you’ve seen significant declines [in job growth].

You know, we, we run a very careful budget process where we’re fully aware that what, that, you know, we owe the we owe that to the public, and we believe we do that. I, I’ve got no further comment than that, thanks.

Chris, I’m not going to I’m not going to react or discuss anything that, that any elected politician might say. So I’ll give you a mulligan.

Sure, I’d be glad to. So we considered this, you know, really at length, and we did decide to withdraw from the NGFS. And, really, the reason is that the, the work that the NGFS does has broadened very significantly. Think about nature related risks and biodiversity and things like that. In addition, the, the work of the NGFS is, is, in, in significant part intended to and this is a quote “mobilize mainstream finance to support the transition toward a sustainable economy.” So we joined to get the benefit of understanding what other central banks were doing and, and seeing research and things like that. I think this is just way beyond any plausible mandate that you could attribute to the Fed, and so we have a quite narrow role, as I’ve as I’ve said many times, and I think that, that the activities of the NGFS are not a good fit for the Fed, given our current mandate and authority. So, you know, and I just think it was time to acknowledge that. You know, the, the process this process dates back thinking about it dates back a couple of years. I made the decision to bring this to the Board, you know, some months ago. It just it just the process just took time to get here, and, and this is when  this is when we, we got in and voted on it, so. And I’m aware of how it can look, but it was really not driven by politics; it was driven by kind of the disconnect between the work of the NGFS and our mandate. Other central banks have different mandates and belong to the NGFS. We have no, no criticism of them. But it just isn’t it’s not right for the Fed.

Well, 2 percent inflation down to inflation down to 2 percent sustainably is what, what we’re trying to achieve. You know, we’re, we’re somewhat above that, as you know, and, you know, we, we want to see, you know, serial readings that suggest that we’re making further progress on inflation. That’s what we want to see. And consumers will, will pick that up, of course, in the things that they buy at the grocery store or at the store.

Yeah, you can’t know with any precision, of course. As I like to say, that you know that you know the neutral rate by its works. So I think, you know, at 4.3 percent we’re, we’re above pretty much everyone on the Committee’s estimates of the longer run neutral. I think our eyes are telling us that our policy is having the effects on the economy. That’s really the question we ask. You know, you can consult models, empirical models, theoretical models. You really have to just look out the window and see how your how your policy rate is affecting the economy. And I think we see that it’s having meaningful effects in bringing inflation under control. It has helped bring the labor market into balance as well. So that’s what we think. I, I would say we’re meaningfully above it. I, I am I, I have no illusion that, that anyone knows precisely how much that is. And, but it, you know not knowing that, and having cut 100 basis points, means that it’s appropriate that we that we not be in a hurry to make further adjustments.

So it’s been it’s been our practice, as I mentioned, to work to align our policies to those that are mentioned in, in the executive orders. And that’s I’m just going to leave it at that. As I mentioned, I’m not going to I’m not going to go any deeper than that or, or get into any deeper into this set of issues today.

Sorry, make a ?

So we just so first of all, thing, things are a little different now. We’ve just come through a high inflation period, and you can argue that both ways. You can 

you can say that companies have figured out that they do like to raise prices, but, but we also hear a lot from companies these days that consumers have really had it with price increases, and so I don’t know how that shakes out. Nonetheless, you’re coming through a situation where we’re not quite back to 2 percent, and that, that’s just different. In addition, you know, the trade the kind of footprint of trade is, has changed a, a lot, as trade is now spread around the, you know it’s not as concentrated in China as it was. There was a lot more manufacturing. It moved to Mexico and other places. So, so there were differences, and I just think the, the range of possibilities is, is very, very wide. We just don’t know, and I, I don’t want to start speculating, as tempting as it is, because we really don’t know. And we didn’t know, by the way, in, I guess, 2018. Yeah, we didn’t really know. And it, you know, the again, the range of possibilities, very, very wide. We don’t know what’s going to be tariff. We don’t know for how long or how much, what countries. We don’t know about retaliation. We don’t know how it’s going to transmit through the economy to consumers. That’s, that really does remain to be seen. You know, there are lots of places where that where that where that price increase from the tariff can show up between the manufacturer and a consumer. Just so many variables. So we’re just going to have to wait and see. And, you know, the best we can do is what we’ve done, which is study up on this and, you know, look at historical experience, read the literature, and think about the factors that might matter, and then we’ll just have to see have to see how it how it goes.

So, on QT, on let’s, let’s talk about runoff. So the most recent data do suggest that reserves are still abundant. Reserves remain roughly as high as they were when runoff began. And the federal funds rate has been very steady within the target range. We track a, a bunch of metrics, and they do tend to point to, to reserves being abundant. We do intend to reduce the size of our balance sheet to a level that’s consistent with implementing monetary policy efficiently and effectively in our ample reserves regime. We’re closely monitoring a, a range of indicators to assess conditions, and that should provide signals whether reserves are approaching a level that could be judged as, quote, “somewhat above ample.” I, I don’t have anything to say to you about particular dates; it’s just that’s the process, and what we see is, is that, that rates do appear to be abundant. As always, we stand ready to take appropriate action to support the smooth transition of monetary policy, including to adjust the details of our approach for reducing the size of the balance sheet in light of economic and financial developments. On, on AI, it’s a big event in, in the stock market and in particular parts of the stock market. I mean, what, what really matters for us is macro developments, and that means substantial changes in financial conditions that are persistent for a period of time. So I wouldn’t put that label on, on these events, although of course we’re all watching it with interest.

So, as you know, as we’ve reduced our, our policy rate 100 basis points, longer rates have gone up. Not because of expectations not principally because of expectations about our policy or about inflation; it’s more a term premium story. So, and, you know, it’s long rates that matter for, for housing. So I, I don’t think I think these higher rates are going to they’re, they’re probably hold back housing activities to some extent, if they’re persistent. We’ll have to see how long they persist. So, you know, we, we are we control an overnight rate. Generally, it, it propagates through the whole family of asset prices, including interest rates. But in this particular case, it’s all happened at a time when, for reasons unrelated to our policy, longer rates have moved up.

No, I wouldn’t say that. We, we’ve never said we need to be all the way at target to reduce rates. At, at any time, what we’re doing is we’re looking at the economy and asking whether our policy stance is the right one to achieve maximum employment and price stability. So I, I think if we would want to see further progress, but we think our we think our as I mentioned, we think that our policy stance is restrictive. Meaningfully restrictive. Not highly restrictive, but meaningfully restrictive. And so I would think we need to see further

progress. I wouldn’t say all the way back down to 2 percent on a sustainable basis, although we’d love to see that, of course, and we will.

You know, we I want to avoid commenting, even indirectly, on the conduct of tariffs. You know, it’s not our job, and it’s not our job to comment on the moves that people make. So I, I wouldn’t want to criticize anything that’s happening or really comment on it one way or another praise it, for that matter. It’s just not our job. I do think that you know, we found in, in 2018, [when] there was a lot of work done on trade policy uncertainty, trade policy uncertainty, if it’s large and persistent, can start to matter for businesses making investment decisions and things like that. That’s not something I’m observing today. It’s very early days for this. But that did I think that did matter in 2018–19. And, and it’s one, you know, one of many things we’ll be watching.

So we, we look we look at, from a financial stability perspective, at asset prices generally, along with things like leverage in the household sector, leverage in the

banking system, funding risk for banks, and things like that. But it’s just one of the four things, asset prices are. And, yeah, I, I’d say they’re elevated by, by many metrics right now. A good part of that, of course, is this thing around tech and AI, but we, we look at that. But, you know, we also we look at how resilient the households and, and businesses and the financial sector are to those things. So we look at that mainly from our financial stability perspective, and we think that there’s a lot of resilience out there. Banks have high capital, and households are actually, overall not all households, but in, in the aggregate, households are in pretty good shape financially these days. So that’s how we think about that. I, you know, we, we also we look at overall financial conditions, and you’ve got you can’t just take you can’t just take equity prices. You’ve got to look at rates, too, and that, you know, that represents a, a tightening in conditions, with higher rates. So, overall, financial conditions are probably still somewhat accommodative, but it’s a mixed bag.

Well, the things we watch, we discussed earlier. One, one is, is that there’s a low hiring rate. And so that if, if there were to be a spike in layoffs, if companies were to start to reduce headcount, you would see unemployment go up pretty quickly, because the hiring rate is quite low. So that, that’s one thing we look at. I think it’s also it’s worth pointing out that for lower income households, they are  they’re under significant pressure. And in the aggregate, the numbers are good, but we know

that people at the lower end of the income spectrum are, are struggling with, with costs. And, really, it’s, it’s high inflation for the basics of life. It’s not so much the inflation now; it’s the price level, because inflation has raised prices. Inflation is now closer much closer to target, but people are really feeling that. But, you know, overall, this is a good labor market. Here you’re at 4.1 percent unemployment. That’s, that’s just a really good level, and you’ve been solidly there now for six, seven months. And job creation is pretty close to a level that will hold the unemployment rate there, given, given that, you know, there’ll be much slower population growth.

You know, we hear anecdotal reports, but I, I don’t see there’s nothing in the data yet on that. But you do you hear you hear that kind of thing about construction, for example. And, and, you know, businesses that are dependent on immigrant labor are, are saying that it’s, it’s suddenly gotten harder to, to get people. But I, again I know you don’t see that in the aggregate data yet, but yes, you, you hear it anecdotally.

NICHOLAS JASINSKI. Thank you,  Nicholas Jasinski from Barron’s. The uncertainty is certainly a theme today, and I’m wondering, are there any periods from your career, or as it relates to markets, the economy, what’s going on here in Washington and beyond, or from lessons from history, that may provide some guidance for a central banker operating in uncertain times like today?

I guess I’d say this: Uncertainty is, is with us all the time. It’s, it is human nature, apparently, to underestimate the how fat the tails are, in a way, that, you know, the, the possibility we think of things in a normal distribution, and in the economy it’s not a normal distribution. The tails are very fat, meaning things can happen way out of your expectations. It’s never not that way. I wouldn’t you know, if you if you think about it  think about the first few months of the pandemic. That was uncertainty. Are we going to be able to reopen the economy? If so, when? How much of it? How long will it take? You know, that was uncertainty. What we have now is a good labor market. We have the economy growing at, you know, 2 to 2½ percent. Inflation’s come down to, to now the, you know the headline inflation number was 2.6 [percent], and that’s what the public experiences. We look at we look at core because it’s a better indicator of future inflation. So, yes, the price level went up a lot for inflation, and people are feeling that, and, and they’re not wrong. But I so the kind of uncertainty we have is just a, a usual level of uncertainty about the economy. But then policies which are, you know, not for us to criticize or, or praise, really those are those are policies which people are, have been elected to implement. They’re implementing them with a view to, to making a better economy. And so I, I don’t think I wouldn’t call this out as, as a  as one of those times. I wouldn’t compare it to the Global Financial Crisis or anything like that, given that we have actually a very good economy right now.

So, as, as I mentioned, the economy’s strong, the labor market’s solid, downside risks to the labor market appear to have abated, and we think disinflation continues on a slow and sometimes bumpy path. That tells me and the other members of the Committee the broad sense of the Committee, actually, is that we don’t need to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance. Your second question was?

You know, it’s one of those things we’ll know it when we see it. But more, more the the expectation is that we will make continued progress, and, you know, that’s what we want. We, we’ll know it when we see it. When we it, it’s going to have to be something that isn’t just idiosyncratic. You’re going to want to see, you know, continued progress with housing services inflation; you’re going to want to see inflation behaving in a way that builds confidence that we are really making progress. That’s what it’s going to be. And, I mean, is, is that better than our expectations? If we expect to see that, it’s just a question of when.

I think to I think that goal has served us well over a long period of time. It’s also the sort of global standard. I think that if, if a central bank wanted to look at changing that, you wouldn’t do it at a time when you’re not meeting it anyway. I would not look

at changing it anyway, but I certainly wouldn’t look at, at it at a time when you’re not when you’re not meeting it. I mean, there’s just no interest at all in changing it, if, if I’m being at all unclear. We’re not we’re not going to change the inflation goal any time soon.

So what we really said was that we wouldn’t we wouldn’t look at a at a strong labor market and raise rates unless we saw some evidence of inflation. So the thought was that we’d seen really low levels of inflation sorry, of unemployment with no sign of inflation. So why would you preemptively want to want to put people out of work in the absence of, of any kind of any evidence that suggested that, that this was not a sustainable level? It was a way of, of acknowledging how much humility we have about, about the starred variables, especially u*, the natural rate of unemployment. So, that was a that, that was an insight. We’ll, we’ll discuss that again. That’ll be one of the many things that we discuss. But I don’t think that insight is wrong. We didn’t you know, we, we what we said was that, you know, in at times when inflation persistently undershot 2 percent, we, we would likely allow inflation to run moderately above 2 percent for some time. That’s what we said. That was  turned out not to be relevant to what actually happened. There was nothing moderate about the overshoot. It was it was an exogenous event. It was the pandemic, and it happened, and, you know, our framework permitted us to act quite vigorously, and we did once we decided that that’s what we should do. Our framework had really nothing to do with the decision to we, we looked at the inflation as, as transitory, and right up to the point where the data turned against

that, and when the data turned against that in late ’21, we changed our, our view, and we raised rates a lot, and here we are at 4.1 percent unemployment and inflation way down. But the framework was, was more irrelevant than anything else. The, the, that part of it that part of it was irrelevant. The rest of the framework worked just fine as, as we used it, as it supported what we did to bring inflation down.

You know, so our, our role with Bitcoin, really, is to look at with crypto, really, is to look at the banks, and, and, you know, we, we think it’s you know, banks are perfectly able to serve crypto customers, as long as they understand and can manage the risks and its safe, safe and soundness. Many of our a good number of our banks that we regulate and supervise do that. You know, the threshold has been a little higher for banks engaging in crypto activities, and that’s because they’re so new, and, you know, we don’t want to make the mistake you’re if you if you’re making a choice to conduct that activity inside a bank which is inside the federal safety net, with deposit insurance, then you want to be pretty sure that, that it’s a safe and sound activity. So, you know, we’re, we’re not against innovation, and we certainly don’t want to, to take actions that would cause banks to, you know, to terminate customers who are

perfectly legal just because of, of excess risk aversion maybe related to regulation and supervision, so.

I, you know, that’s, that’s kind of a it’s not really our, our bailiwick. You want people to be knowledgeable about the financial engagements that they have, and that’s why we have, you know, the securities law, laws that we have. It’s why, you know, if you read a mutual fund prospectus or individual stock prospectus, you, you want households to have the chance to understand the risk that they’re taking. And, you know, I, I do think it would be helpful if there were a greater regulatory apparatus around crypto, and I think that, that’s something Congress was working on quite a lot. We’ve actually spent a lot of time, you know, with members of Congress working together with them on, on various things, and I, I think that would be a very constructive thing for, for Congress to do. Thank you.
