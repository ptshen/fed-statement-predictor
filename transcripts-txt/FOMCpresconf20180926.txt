So the tightening cycle, as you know, is a reflection of the strength of the economy. And it’s almost three years now that we’ve been gradually raising rates. And I think the fact that we have moved quite gradually, in a way, allows us to carefully watch incoming data in the real economy and in the financial markets to see how the economy is processing higher interest rates. And the fact that we’re moving so graduallyI think itI think it limits the long and variable lags problem because, you know, we’re being able to raise rates and then wait and see how the economy absorbs these rate increases. And so far, the economy has performed very well and very much in keeping with our expectations.

So we’ve been given a really important job to do on behalf of the American people by Congress, and we’ve been given the tools to do it, and my colleagues and I are focused exclusively on carrying out that mission. We consider the best thinking, the best theory, and the best evidence. We have disparate points of view, which we debate extensively and come to a perspective and try to set monetary policy to achieve maximum employment in a context of price stability. That’s what we do. We don’t consider political factors or things like that. And so that’s who we are, that’s what we do, and that’s just the way it’s always going to be for us.

Sure. So in terms of financial markets and monetary policy, weas we say in our statement every cycle, we do take financial conditions into consideration because financialbroader financial conditions do affect the broader economy, and they’re one of the many things that we take into account. The part of it that we control, though, is what we do with the federal funds rate and that hasthat has effects out through, you know, out through the full interest rate curve and into financial asset prices generally. So the answer is, we take everything into account, but, you know, broader financial conditions are just one of the things that we take into account. In terms of ’20 and ’21, whyyour question was why the funds rate needs to be above neutral? So you’re right. Some ofsome of the participants have mostly very modest overshoots of their personal estimates of neutral a couplethree years out. You know, it’s far out into the future. I think it’s hard to be confident that that’sthat that’s the way things are going to be. What we’re going to be doing as weas we go through time is asking at every meeting whether monetary policy is set to achieve our goals. And I think that that’s an assessment of where policy will need to be some years down the road, and I’ll leave it at that.

No, you’re right. The Committee forecasts what theywhat they show, in general, is an economy where unemployment remains in the high and middle 3s throughout the entire forecast period and inflation remains very close to 2 percent. That is what the forecast shows. And that is based on our understanding of the way the inflation process works now and on the fact that the inflation seems to be fairly nonreactive to changes in slack that is to say, a flat Phillips curve. And it’s justit’s ait’s a world of strongly anchored inflation expectations. And that’s not just our forecast, that’s many forecasts. So that isthat is that is the forecast. So you may askI mean, the sense is, what does the longerrun natural rate of unemployment mean? And so that really is a longerrun concept that we think the economy will return to over the longer run. But, obviously, that longer run, you know, isn’t it’s not creating problems in the short run for that forecast. Now let’s just admit that the inflation process has changed dramatically from where it was in the 1960s to where it is now. It’s in a good place now. We can’t take for granted that it will remain the way it is, and, you know, we will be, of course, watching carefully. If inflation reacts more strongly or more weakly to the strong economy, then we’ll adjust policy appropriately.

Well, interest rates, of course, have effects on growth, have effectsI mean ifI guess theyour question was, what are you buying with by raising interest rates? The question is, what would the economy look like if you didn’t raise rates? It would look very different, I think, if we didn’t raise rates. We’re always trying to, you know, work our way between thesort of the twothe two problems we face. One is that if we move too quickly, we can, you know, snuff out a recovery unnecessarily, and inflation falls short of its 2 percent target. Or if we move too slowly, we have an economy that can overheat. So we’rethatthat’s happened through history. We don’t see any signs of that now, but we’re always trying to navigate between those two shoals. And we think that gradually, you know, raising interest rates is the way that we kind of take both of those risks seriously.

So I think one of the most important lessons from the financial crisis is really the importance of the stability of the financial system. And so wesince the financial crisis, as you’re aware, we’ve had a major focus on building up our monitoring of financial conditions and financial stability issues. We’ve also put in place many, many initiatives to strengthen the financial system through higher capital and better regulation, more transparency, central clearing, margins on uncleared derivatives, all kinds of things like that, which are meant to strengthen the financial system. We’ve done many of those things, and we feel that the financial system is in a much better place. As we look atas we look at conditions most recentlyand this was at our last meeting, and it was in our minutes for the last meetingquarterly, we have a briefing at the FOMC, and also at the Board, of the staffs’ views on financial stability, and the staff judged the overall vulnerabilities to be moderate. If you dig into the different aspects of that question, households or balance sheets are in good shape. You know, employment is high, wages are rising, that sort of thing. The banking system, as I mentioned, isyou know, much higher capital, much higher liquidityis much stronger. If you look at asset prices, it is true that some asset prices are in the upper range of their historicalupper reach of their historical ranges. And then if you look at nonfinancial corporates, you getthere is the story of leverage there. So it’s not that there aren’t any vulnerabilities, but we see them as moderate. Now, you ask about the countercyclical capital buffer. The countercyclical capital buffer is a tool that we added to our toolkit, I think, finally, back in 2016. We said that we would deploy it when vulnerabilities were meaningfully above normal. We revisit that on a regular schedule, and the last time we revisited it was, I think, last yearsometime last yearand concluded that the test was not met. As I mentioned at the last briefing, theyou know, the assessment was that vulnerabilities were moderate, but it remains a kita tool for our toolkit that we can deploy, you know, when and as we feel appropriate.

As I said, I think I’m in the camp of seeing vulnerabilities as relatively moderate. I think the financial systemI think another thing that we learned in the crisis is that we need to be alert to the buildup of vulnerabilities as a long expansion continues. I don’t see that in troublingtroubling amounts at this point, but, you know, I think it’s appropriate for us to monitor that very carefully.

Sure. So I guess I need to start by saying that we’re not responsible for trade policy, and we don’t comment on particular, you know, trade actions and that sort of thing. But you will have seen that we have this very extensive network of business contacts around the country through the Reserve Banks largely, and we’ve been hearing a rising chorus of concerns from businesses all over the country about disruption of supply chains, materials costs and increases, and loss of markets, and things like that. So we’ve been hearing quite a lot of that, and wethe Reserve Bank presidents talk about it in the meeting, and it goes in the minutes. So we, you know, that’swe’re very transparent about hearing all that. I think if you look at the aggregate performthe performance of the U.S. economy at an aggregateat a national level, it’s hard to see much happening at this point. Andor you can look at it the other way: You can ask, if all of the tariffs that have been announced are applied, what would be the effect at the aggregate level? And they’re still relatively small. You know, we worry about a couple of things. One is loss of business confidence, which could reduce investment. Again, we don’t really see effects that we could measure yet. Also, the possibility of a financial market reaction over time to unexpected trade developments. More than anything, though, I would worry, in the longer run, where this is going, you know. If the if the end place we get to is lower tariffs, that would be good, you know. Trade generally supports productivity, supports higher incomes. And, you know, fair tradefair trade under internationally accepted rules can be a good thing. I think if this, perhaps inadvertently, goes to a place where we have widespread tariffs that remain in place for a long timea more protectionist worldthat’s going to be bad for the United States’ economy and for American workers, and families, and also for other economies.

So it’s true. This year haswe’ve kept raising our forecast for this year. Thisas the year’s gone on, the economy has come in stronger than we expected, and that’s a really good thing. And the economy, as I mentioned at the beginning, is strong, and there’s good reason to expect that to continue. You ask why. You know, some of it is, no doubt, the effect of the fiscal policy changes, the tax cuts, and the spending increasesthat’s got to be part of the story. Part of it may be higher oil prices, which are calling for more investment in the oil patch. But, you know, the growth picture is very much supported by very high readings of household confidence, business confidence, so it’s ait’s ait’s ait’s a pretty particularly bright moment, I think. If you look back over the last decade, this is a pretty good moment for the U.S. economy.

Oh, supplyside effects, yeah. So, you know, we hope they’re huge, frankly. You know, the idea is, you cutyou reduce taxation on corporations and particularlyand allow faster expensing for investment. The idea is to encourage more investment, and that is one of the things that drives productivity, which is one of the main things that drives rising incomes. So the effects are very uncertain, they’reyou know, they’rethe literature isit’sthere’s no clear answer to exactly how these mechanisms work or how effective they are. And it would be soon to be seeing supplyside effects. The othersupply side effects are probably both more uncertain and they’re probably slower to come in. But, you know, as I said, weI certainly hopeI hope that we’ll be marking up our estimates of potential growth as well.

Okay, so I think I mentioned in the opening remarks maybe something that addressed your question about what would make us go faster and slower. You know, the main thing where we might need to move along a little bit quicker would be if inflationinflation surprises to the upside. We don’t see that. We really don’t see that. It’s not in our forecast, but anyso I wouldI regard that as a risk. I think either a significant significantcorrection and lasting correction in financial markets or a slowing down in the economy that’s inconsistent with our forecastthose are the kinds of things we’d react to. In terms of what, you know, what we would doyou know, I think we’re always going to be adjusting monetary policy toin light of conditions on the ground. So if the economy is weakening, then it’s very possible we’d bewe’d be cutting rates and, you know, vice versa. And so I can’t rule that out. ItI think it’s quite difficult, though, to know what the effects what the sort of end effects of fiscal policy are going to be in 2020. It’s difficult to know what the policy will be, let alone what their effects will be that far out. So we have to make estimates, but we know that they’re highly uncertain.

You meanyou mean, where’s the point at which inflation unemployment is too low? Yeah. Yeah. You know, so we’ve beenI think the performlabor force participation has surprised us on the upside. There is a longrun trend there, and we’ve now had basically five flat years. If you lookif you look at labor force participation, since the fourth quarter of ’13 till now, you really have akind of an oscillation that basically is a sideways movement in the face of a significant downward trend, thanks to aging and other factors. That’s a gain of well more than a percentage point in participation, so that’s really that’s really a good thing. Those are people who are remaining in contact with the labor force and looking for jobs, finding jobs. So that’s a great thing. And, by the way, it’s a signal. It’s one of the things that has allowed the unemployment rate not to fall further. And it’s ait’s a signal, too, that there may be more there on the supply side, that there may be more labor supply than the prior trend would indicate. So it’s a very positive thing to see people staying in the labor force. And, you know, we don’t know how long it can continue. We have models, and we look at thiswe look at this question all the time. And, you know, admittedly, we’ve been surprised on the positive side here, so we’re open to the idea that that may continue or not.

It’s a concern. It’s a risk. You know, so you could see prices moving up. You don’t see it yet, but weyou could see retail prices moving up. The tariffs might provide a basis for companies to raise prices in a world where they’ve been very reluctant to and unable to raise prices, where raising prices is really difficult, you know, with the ability to shop on the internet. This could provide, you know, a way foragain, we don’t see it in the numbers. And, you know, until we see it in the numbers, it’s hard to say how one would react. And the other question would be, if you’re just talking about the effect on inflation is, is it just a onetime increase in the price level, or is it actually fueling higher inflation going forward? And that’s a realthat’s an important question in, in how we would think about the appropriate response.

Don’t see it yet. You know, don’t see it yet, but weyou’re hearingI mean, broadly across the economy, it’s not just tariffs. You’re hearingwe’re hearing a lot of talk of labor shortages, of material costs in particular industries. We’re hearing a lot, you know, what amount to supplyside constraints and things like that, but we’re not seeing it. We’re seeing a sort of modest increase in wages, inflation right around 2 percent, no sense of it moving up really, so we’re not seeing it yet. And, you know, we just aren’t, and we’re watching very carefully.

A couple questions in there. So the dot plotI mean, Iit’s not new. I don’t think it’s a new point that forecasts two and three outtwo or three years out are fairly uncertain. The dot plot is individual FOMC participants who are writing down their individual views on the evolution of the economy and of appropriate monetary policy. We don’t vote on that. These are individual forecasts. I think market participants generally find that interesting information, and so it seems to me to be serving a purpose. I think the point with “accommodative” was that its useful life was over. You know, we put that in the statement in 2015, just when we lifted off, and the idea was to provide assurance that we weren’t trying to slow down the economy, but, in fact, we were stillinterest rates were still going to be pushing to support economic activity. Well, thatyou know, that purpose has been well served, and the language now doesn’t really say anything that’s important to the way the Committee is thinking about policy going forward. That’s why that came out. Did I get did I get all of your ques?

Yeah, you know, it’sif you look at a broad financial conditions index, that’s pretty much the answer you’ll get. We don’t control that, and, as I mentioned earlier, we do take financial conditions into account in what we do. And financial conditions are affecting the broader economy, so, by definition, we’re taking them into account. But if you look atlook at interest rates, you know, interest rateslook at longterm interest rates this year and shortterm interest rates this year, there’s very significant increases. And, you know, with your long and variable lags, that should bethat should be having an effect over time.

Okay, so in terms of nominations to the Fed, those are entirely, completely under the control of the White House and, ultimately, the President. And traditionally, the Fed Chair has been consulted on those, and I’m happy to say that that has continued. But these arethese are really decisions for the White House, and, you know, we arethink of us as just being consulted. I will say that I’m very happy and excited about the team that we’re putting together, and I’m very much looking forward to having those offices up and down our hall filled. It’s been pretty quiet, more quieter than usual, which is saying something on the Board hall. So we’re looking forward to getting some people confirmed. In terms of corporate debt, so this is athis is ayou know, I was an investor for a long time in areas that were very close to the leveraged lending markets. So, you know, I have had a lot of experience in that. That market has evolved really significantly since before the crisis. And, you know, the banks take much less risk than they used to. They’rethethey’re essentially in the business of distributing these loans and bonds rather than keeping them on their balance sheet, to a much greater degree. But it’s also trueand there’s significant research on thisthat excessive risktaking in the leveraged lending markets does have channels for affecting the real economy, if there’s overheating and that kind of thing in those markets, so we monitor that carefully. You know, the guidance isisn’t binding, as you pointed out, that the leveraged lending isn’t binding, and that’s justthat’s just the way that the law is interpreted. So it’s something we’re monitoring, and, as I mentioned, we think overall vulnerabilities are moderate.

Okay, so are we accommodative now? So I think if you look at thelook at the dot plot in the SEP, you’ll see that the federal funds rate, even after today’s move, is below the longerrun neutral estimate of every single participant thatwho submits a an estimate of that. So that’s why this is the perfect time to take the language out, because, you know, it’s perfectly clear that there can’t be a signal because, you know, by definition, that means an accommodative policy. So it wasn’t because policy is not accommodative. It is still accommodative. The thinking was more, as I mentioned, it’s more that the language has run its useful life. There’s another point, though, too, which is, you know, we don’t want to suggest either that we have this precise understanding of where “accommodative” stops or suggest that that’s a really important point in our thinking. You know, what we’re going to be doing, assuming we stay on this path, is, we’re going to be carefully monitoring incoming data from the financial markets and from the economy and asking ourselves whether our policy is achieving the goals we want to achieveyou know, sustain the economy, maximum employment, stable prices. That’s the way we’re thinking about it, and that does kind of amount to thinking less about one’s precise point estimate of the neutral rate. So that’s how I think about that.

It’s possible. It’s very possible. It happens often. And, as I mentioned, many of the participants have written that down, and they’ve written down really modest overshoots, you know, amounting to one rate hike kind of thing, which wouldn’t have a big effect on the economy. You know, itI would just say, you know, it really depends on what happens. It depends on if we keep goingyou can think of it different ways. Maybe we’ve underestimated the neutral rate. Maybe we’ll be raising our estimate of the neutral rate and we’ll just go to that, or maybe we’ll keep our neutral rate here and then go one or two rate increases beyond it. I think it’s very possible, but I mean, ultimately, isn’t really the question we’re answering. The question we’re answering is, how do we provide the economy just the right amount of support not too much, not too littleto sustain the recovery and achieve our statutory goals?

So, three things there. The first thing is the single biggest thing I think that we learned was theas I mentioned, I think, earlier, the importance of maintaining the stability of the financial system. So I think if you lookif you look back at the way the models worked and the way people thought about risk in the economy, that’s what was missing, and I think it’s not missing anymore. So weyou know, we put a tremendous focus on that. We raised capital, liquidity. We have stress tests, which force banks to understandthe largest banks particularlyto understand and better manage their risk and have enough capital to survive a really substantial shock that’s at least as bad as the financial crisis. And if all that doesn’t work, we’ve got resolution plans, which we’ve, you know, through many cycles, have made really substantial progress, more than I had thought was likely. So we’ve done a lot. Nobody’syou know, nobody is, I think, overconfident that we’ve solved every problem. And, you know, now we’re going back and kind of taking a hard look at everything and, you know, trying to maketrying totrying to keep at it. So I think those are the really important lessons, and, you know, wewe’re determined not to, you know, not to forget them. And that’s, I think, a risk nowis tois to forget things that wethat we learned. That’s just human nature over time. I saw the article you’re talking about; the question is, did Congress take things away, emergency powers from the Fed? So there was sort of a trade for taking away our power under 13, section 13(3), to provide support to individual nonbanks, which is really holding companies and other companies. In exchange for that, we got orderly liquidation authority and a resolution authority. Was it a mistake? I don’t think there’s any sense that Congress would seriously look at changing that. I have real doubts about whether it was wise to take away our crisisfighting tools. I think you put them away, and you hope you never need them, butand I certainly strongly oppose efforts to take away more of our tools. You know, the third thing you mentioned is the designation power. So it’s a really important power. In my mind, it should be usedmy thinking, it should be used sparingly, and that means, you know, in situations where you haveI mean, in principle, you could have another Lehman Brothers come up out of the ground that’s not a bank, and it could be very threateningor it could be capable of creating systemic risk. And so I think it’s a critical power to have. But, again, I would use itI would tend to use it fairly sparingly.

Yeah, we lookof course, we look at that very carefully, and interest rates are going up across a broad range of consumer borrowing, as they would when we raise shortterm interest rates. They’re still quite low by historical levels. And the other thing I’ll say is, takeif you take housing, if you look at the NAR Affordability Index, housing is still more affordable now than it was before the financial crisis. So you’re right that the cost of borrowing is going up, but it’s going up from what were extraordinarily low levels, and it is something that we watch carefully. You know, the effect on consumer spending is a very important channel through which interest rates work, and so we do monitor the effects.

Well, at the Fed, we are, you know, deeply committed to the mission of CRA, which is for banks to provide credit and other banking services in the communities they serve. And we have also been of the view for some time that with the evolution of technology particularly and changeschanges in the nature of banking, that it’s an appropriate timeit’s past an appropriate time, but now it’s certainly an appropriate time to revisit the way we think about CRA. But we don’t want to lose that focus on community, and, you know, we definitely want to see that fundamental purpose of the law sustained. Many of the issues that we had were reflected in the OCC’s ANPR, and we’rewe’re hopeful that, over time, there will be a joint proposed rulemaking with the OCC, the FDIC, and the Fed. It’s a process, and, you know, we’re very much interested in continuing to push it forward.

So, in principle, thethese starred variablesthe longrun growth rate of the economy, the neutral rate of interest, the natural rate of unemploymentdon’t move quickly. They move very gradually. They’re pinned down by longerrun forces, like demographics. In the case of the funds rate, it’s moreit’s productivityit’s appetite for safe assets and demographics and other things, too. So they move quite slowly through time. I think we all look at themthose of us who file SEPs every quarter will look at that every quarter and not make a change every quarter but, every now and again, make a change. And you’re rightwe actuallythe median ticked up a tenth. It’s a tenth we’re talking about here, sobut still, I think it’s a positive thing that people could be raising their estimates of the longerrun neutral rate and potentially the longerrun growth rate. Who knows? And maybe reducing their level of the natural rate of unemployment, which has been the trend. It’s just that you change those estimates over time. They’re informed by incoming data. They don’t change a lot, though, although they didit’s interesting that the neutral rate changed quite sharply after the financial crisis in many different models, and it’s been slow to recover. I don’t expect a dramatic recovery there, but, you know, wewe’re so bad at forecasting productivity. It’s just very hard to know when productivity is going to arrive and in what quantity. So I think we have to be humble about how little we really know about where these starred value variables either are or are going.

Sure. So, you know, some of the things that we’d be looking at to tell us whether we’re getting close to supplyside limits would be, first, does job growth slow down? A slowing down in job growth would be an indicator, you know. An unexpectedly sharp increase in wages or inflation could tell you that you’re reaching those points. You know, if headline growth slowed down, that’s another one. So all of those things would be worth taking into consideration. I think also, though, we’ve seen sometimes sharp tightening in financial conditions, as we saw at the beginning of 2016, can have a substantial effect pretty quickly on our economy if it’s a broad and significant tightening. So we would be looking for those kinds of things and many other things. So, in terms of divergence, yes. So the U.S. economy is, as I mentioned, is strong and is at a pretty positive moment, you know, with strong growth, healthy labor market, inflation right on target, as I mentioned. Soand we’ve seen growth abroad, but growth, I think, both in advanced economies and in some emerging economies has slowed down a little bit. And in that world, you know, if the U.S. is stronger, then that’s just part of the context, part of the environment that could mean a higher dollar. It could beit could therefore mean that some of our demand will wind up being shared with other economies. That’s the way the integrated international economy works. So you could see that, and, you know, it’s justit’s just all of theall things that go into thinking about, you know, the path of the economy. I would say, you know, we’re not responsible for the dollar. Of course, the Treasury is responsible for managing the dollar, but the dollar has only partly recovered the decline that it had in 2017. It’s moved up off its lows, but it’s not as high as it was at the beginning of last year yet by a significant margin.

So we’ve said that we would use our tools to assure that the federal funds rate trainstrades within the target range. And the principal tools we use have been interest on excess reserves and then, at the bottom end, a reverse repo facility. So wein June, when we raised rates, we only raised the interest on excess reserves by 20 basis points and raised the range by 25, and that moved federal funds sort of back into the range. It worked, and it was successful. The federal funds rate traded in the low 190s, well within the range. We maywe may do that again. You know, weagain, we have our tools, and we will use them. We think it’s principally a function just of a number of things, but particularly high Treasury supply, andwhich is showing up in repo rates and then showing up in fed funds as well. So we don’t see it as aas a big problem. We see it as a problem we can address with our tools, and we’ll use them if we have to.

So I wouldn’t comment on a CEA paper, and I would imagine they probably wouldn’t comment on our stuff, either, but I would just say this. So I am familiar with the question and the work. You know, we lookwe look at a range of indicators of wages, and I think the broader, the better. You reallyin a perfecta perfect wage measure would also include benefits, because a lot of compensation these days shows up in the form of benefits rather than wages, so I think it’s right to choose those broader ones. But they’re kind of all telling the same story right now. If you look at the principal four that we look atwe look at a whole range of wage and benefit cost indicatorsthey are all now showing wages and benefits around 3 percent growth, right? Clustered around 3 percent. That’s a full percentage point higher than it was five years ago. That’s a good thing. Then the questionthe other question is, what about inflation? You know, if you’reif you’re looking for real wage increases, you’ve got to ask inflation, and there, you have to pick an inflation measure. Some people pick CPI. We, of course, pick personal consumption expenditures because we think it’s a little better measure. It’s a little broader, and it tends to run a little bit lower as well, but that’s not why we pick it. We just think it’s more accurate. And thatthe trend there is running around 2 percent, so if wages are running at roughwages and benefits running at roughly 3 percent and inflation running at around 2 percent. PCE headline inflation is at 2.3 percent. PCE core is at about 2, and I think we see that, you know, the temporary increase in headline inflation as being a function of oil prices probably, and we expect inflation to go back down to 2 percent. So we think of that as 2 percent. That’s how we think about it. Is thatI hope that helps.

So it doesn’t really come up. It’s not really our job. And we dowe do monetary policy. We regulate financial institutions, financial stability, that sort of thing. We don’t have responsibility for fiscal policy. But in the longerrun, fiscal policy will have a significant effect on the economy, so for that reason, I think my predecessors have commented on fiscal policy. But they’ve commented onat a high level rather than trying to get involved in particular, you know, particular measures. And soand Imy plan is to kind of stick to the same approach and stay in our lane. And, you knowso I would just say, it’sit’s no secret, it’s been true for a long time that with our uniquely expensive healthcare delivery system and the aging of our population, we’ve been on an unsustainable fiscal path for a long time, and there’s no hiding from it. In the end, we will have to face that, and I think, you know, the sooner, the better. And also, these are good times. These are, you know, this isthis is the economy at nearly full employment or in the rangein the neighborhood of full employment. Interest rates are low. It’s ait’s a good time to be addressing these things. So I justI put that out there and leave it at that.

Sorry, the second question was?

Oh, to stop.

Well, we serve a domestic mandate, which is assigned to us by Congress, and that is to have maximum employment and stable prices. About half of global GDP is outside the United States, and way more than half of the growth is outside the United States and in emerging markets, I should say. And so the performance in the emerging market economies really, really matters to us in carrying out our domestic mandate. I’d also say that, you know, a strong U.S. economy, where Americans are buying things and the economy is growing and ouryou know, that’s going to support demand all around the globe, so that’s a good thing. Now, we do understand, though, that when wewhen our economy is strong and we’re raising rates, that puts upward pressure on interest rates around the world and can affect countries, particularly countries that have significant external dollar borrowing. And what we try to do is be very transparent about what we’re doing and why. And we have been, I believe, and we’ve also moved quite gradually. So Iyou know, I think we’ve been performing well on that front. There are some countries that arethat are undergoing severe stress, a handful of them, andbut not most emerging market countries. It’s a relatively small number, and those particular countries have, you know, have particular vulnerabilities, which are well known in the form of budget deficits, and significant external dollar borrowings, and high inflation, and things like that. So, again, we’ll continue to conduct U.S. monetary policy as transparently as we possibly can, and that’s really the best thing we can do, along with supporting U.S. growth. I’ll justI think that answers both your questions, actually.

But, you know, I wouldn’t want toI wouldn’t want to speculate about what the consequences of a market correction should be.
