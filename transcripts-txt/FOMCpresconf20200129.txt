Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for being here. At today’s meeting, my colleagues and I decided to leave our policy rate unchanged. As always, we base our decisions on our judgment of how best to achieve the goals Congress has given us: maximum employment and price stability. We believe monetary policy is well positioned to serve the American people by supporting continued economic growth, a strong job market, and a return of inflation to our symmetric 2 percent goal. The expansion is in its 11th year, the longest on record. Growth in household spending moderated toward the end of last year, but with a healthy job market, rising incomes, and upbeat consumer confidence, the fundamentals supporting household spending are solid. In contrast, business investment and exports remain weak, and manufacturing output has declined over the past year. Sluggish growth abroad and trade developments have been weighing on activity in these sectors. However, some of the uncertainties around trade have diminished recently, and there are some signs that global growth may be stabilizing after declining since mid2018. Nonetheless, uncertainties about the outlook remain, including those posed by the new coronavirus. Overall, with monetary and financial conditions supportive, we expect moderate economic growth to continue. The unemployment rate has been near halfcentury lows for well more than a year, and the pace of job gains remains solid. Participation in the labor force by people in their prime working years, ages 25 to 54, is at its highest level in more than a decade. And wages have been rising, particularly for lowerpaying jobs. People who live and work in middleincome communities and lowincome communities tell us that many who have struggled to find work are now finding new opportunities. Employment gains have been broad based across all racial and ethnic groups and all levels of education. These developments underscore for us the importance of sustaining the expansion so that the strong job market reaches more of those left behind. Inflation continues to run below our symmetric 2 percent objective. Over the 12 months through November, total PCE inflation was 1.5 percent, and core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, was 1.6 percent. Available data suggest similar inflation readings for December, though we expect inflation to move closer to 2 percent over the next few months as unusually low readings from early 2019 drop out of the calculation. While low and stable inflation is certainly a good thing, inflation that runs persistently below our objective can lead longerterm inflation expectations to drift down, pulling actual inflation even lower. In turn, interest rates would be lower as wellcloser to their effective lower bound. As a result, we would have less room to reduce interest rates to support the economy in a future downturn to the detriment of American families and businesses. We have seen this dynamic play out in other economies around the world, and we are determined to avoid it here in the United States. In particular, we believe the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate to support sustained economic growth, a strong labor market, and inflation returning to our 2 percent symmetric 2 percent objective. As long as incoming information about the economy remains broadly consistent with this outlook, the current stance of monetary policy likely will remain appropriate. We will be monitoring the effects of the policy actions we took last year, along with other information bearing on the outlook, as we assess the appropriate path of the target range for the federal funds rate. Of course, if developments emerge that cause a material reassessment of our outlook, we would respond accordingly. Policy is not on a preset course. I will conclude with a brief overview of our current plans for our technical operations to implement monetary policy. The plan the FOMC announced back in October to purchase Treasury bills and conduct repo operations has proceeded smoothly and has succeeded in providing an ample supply of reserves to the banking system and effectively controlling the federal funds rate. In light of the resulting stability in the federal funds rate and money market conditions more generally, we decided to make a small technical upward adjustment to administered rates to ensure that the federal funds rate trades well within the target range. This action reverses the small downward adjustment made in September when money markets were volatile. As our bill purchases continue to build reserves toward levels that maintain ample conditions, the role played by active repo operations will naturally recede. Over the first half of this year, we intend to adjust the size and pricing of repo operations as we transition away from their active use in supplying reserves. This process will take place gradually, and, as indicated in today’s FOMC directive to the Desk, we expect to continue offering repos at least through April to ensure a consistently ample supply of reserves. Based on current projections, we expect that the underlying level of reserves will durably reach ample levels sometime in the second quarter of this year. As we get close to that point, we intend to slow the pace of purchases and transition to a program of smaller reserve management purchases that maintains an ample level of reserves without the active use of repos. At that point, as in the precrisis period, our balance sheet will be expanding gradually over time, reflecting the trend growth in the demand for currency and other Federal Reserve liabilities. All of these technical measures are designed to support the efficient and effective implementation of monetary policy and are not intended to represent a chancea change in the stance of monetary policy. We are committed to completing the transition to our longerrun amplereserves regime smoothly and predictably. Of course, we will continue to closely monitor conditions in money markets, and we will adjust these plans as conditions warrant. Thank you, and I’ll be happy to take your questions.

Yes. So, in making that change, our goal was, reallythat was, changing “near” to “returning to”was to avoid possible misinterpretation. So you may remember, in the December minutes we noted that a few Committee members suggested that the language that stated that monetary policy would support inflation near 2 percent could be misinterpreted as suggesting that policymakers were comfortable with inflation running below that level. So we thought about that in the intermeeting period and concluded that it would be appropriate to adjust that language to send a clearer signal that we’re not comfortable with inflation rising persistentlyrunning persistently below our 2 percent symmetric objective. So, yes, there is something in that. It’s just that we wanted to underscore our commitment to 2 percent not being a ceiling to inflation running aroundsymmetrically around 2 percent, and that we’re not satisfied with inflation running below 2 percent, particularly at a time such as now where we’re a long way into an expansion and a long way into a period of very low unemployment when, in theory, inflation should be moving up.

Sure. So, thanks for that question. Why don’t I say a few things about repos, since I know that’ll be of interest. So, just to bring you back, after last September’s brief turmoil, we took prompt and decisive action, and a resultas a result, money markets have been operating smoothly since then. Just to review, those two adjustments were Treasury bill purchases of at leastof $60 billionsorryat least into the second quarter, and term and overnight repo at least through April. And I will get to your specific question. The purpose of the adjustments has been to assure that our policy is transmitted smoothly to the federal funds rate, which requires wellfunctioning money markets. It doesn’t mean we’re trying to eliminate all volatility in the repo markets. We know that some volatility is normal and expected in wellfunctioning markets. And, as I mentioned, these adjustments have been successful in supplying an ample quantity of reserves. Money markets operated smoothly, including right through yearend, and the fed funds rate has remained in our target range. So we knowwe will know when these adjustments have run their course when reserves are durably at a level that enables us to control the federal funds rate using our administered rates, the interest on reserves and reverse repo, without the need for frequent use of open market operations. Based on current projections, we expect that the bill purchases will durably bring the underlying level of reserves to the ample level sometime in the second quarter of this year. And when we see that we’ve reached that level, we’ll begin to gradually reduce our asset purchases to the level of the underlying trend growth of demand for our liabilities. As our bill purchases bring the underlying level of reserves up to an ample level on a sustained basis, the necessary quantity of overnight and term repo will gradually decline. We’ve already begun the gradual reduction in the quantity of repo, and we’ll continue to reduce those offering amounts gradually as conditions permit. At some point, we’ll also raise the minimum bid rate. Even after we reach an ample level of reserves, it’s possible that repo operations might play a role as a backstop and support effective control of the federal funds rate. And we’ll continue to discuss that issue and review it under our implementation framework. Coming to your question, in terms of the actually desired reserve level, we know that reserves will continue to move up and down over the course of the calendar year in a wide range depending on volatility in nonreserve liabilities, particularly the Treasury General Account, or

The labor market continues toto perform well. The labor market continues to be strong. We see strong job creation. We see low unemployment. Very importantly, we see labor force participation continuing to move up, really, against expectations. If you go back a few years, you will not find a lot of forecasts suggesting that we could have been at 63.2 percent overall labor force participation or the levels of employment to population that we’re seeing now, let alone the unemployment level. So I think we’ve learned quite a lot of good things about the labor market, good things suggesting that there’s been more room to run. The performance of wages, I think, has to be seen in that context. We sawif you go back four or five years, the four or five major wage statistics that we track were running at around 2 percent, and now they’re running at around 3 percent, which is theoretically about where they might be at full employment. It would consist of inflation plusplus productivity growth. Theit’s a bit surprising that, with sustained levels of historically low unemployment, we haven’t seen wages moving up above that level as we have in other long expansions and other periods of low unemployment. So you asked, what can be explaining that? You know, one thing can be that the natural rate of unemployment is still lower than we think, that the labor market is not as tight as it would appear just from the 3½ percent number. And the other can be, I think, thatas I mentioned, the sort of supplyside shock or surprise that we’re receiving from higher labor force participation. People are coming in to the labor market and providing more labor supply, and that isthat’s a great thing. That’s a very healthy thing. We’re a country that has low labor force participation compared to essentially all of our advancedeconomy peers, and it’s a very good, positive thing. Nonetheless, it represents more labor supply, and it may be holding down wages.

Thanks. I’ll just say that we undertook the review because we felt, and I felt, that it was time to incorporate the realities of what we could call the “new normal” into our policy framework. And some aspects of that new normal would include ongoing powerful global disinflationary trends, which have led to lowerthantarget inflation many places in the world; secondly, a flat Phillips curve, by which I mean low levels of sensitivity of inflation to resource utilizationfor example, low unemployment; and, thirdly, a much lower neutral real interest rate here and around the world. So those are challenging conditions for monetary policy to deliver on our statutory goals of maximum employment and stable prices, although I would say that, under our existing framework, we’ve been able to succeed or get close to succeeding it for most of the time lately to achieve those goals, although we do struggle, as other central banks do, with the inflation goal. So this is about reviewing our strategy, tools, and communications to assure that they’re the best that we can do to achieve those goals in this environment on a sustained basis. And we continued our discussions at this meeting. I’m very, very pleased at the process so far. It’s included the 14 Fed Listens events around the country, at which we’ve engaged with a full range of people and groups across American society. That was a very, very positive experience, and I think we learned a lot. We’ve now had a series ofa number of FOMC meetings at which we’ve reviewed what we’ve learned and also dug deeply into strategy, tools, and communications. I expect that we will conclude the review and announce our conclusions around the middle of the year. Right now, we are just at the point of coming together to put all that together. So I think I’m not the person who should be telling you my personal preferences right now. I’m trying toand we were trying to come together as a group around a set of answers. I feel very positive aboutthat we’re going to come up with some good results, and I’m just going to have to wait until we get to that point to announce them.

So let me talk about the coronavirus specifically, and then I’ll turn more to global growth more generally. First, it’s ait’s a very serious issue, and I want to start by acknowledging the significant and considerable human suffering that the virus is already causing. There is likely to be some disruption to activity in China and possibly globally based on the spread of the virus to date and the travel restrictions and business closures that have already been imposed. Of course, the situation is really in its early stages, and it’s very uncertain about how far it will spread and what the macroeconomic effects will be in China and its immediate trading partners and neighbors and around the world. So, in light of that uncertainty, I’m not going to speculate about it at this point. I will just tell you that, of course, we are very carefully monitoring the situation. And, you know, as you suggested, our framework ultimately is, what are the potential ramifications for the U.S. economy and for the achievement of our dual mandate? More broadly, though, if I can talk about the global economy for a secondand if you look at the backdrop, you know, if you go back to 2017, that was the year of synchronized growth that lasted into the middle of 2018, and then you saw slowing in growth, which lasted right through the end of last year. The fourthquarter growth globally was quite weak last year, and a number of factors played into that. It wasn’t any one factor. There was trade policy uncertainty, absolutely, but also there was the decision by the Chinese authorities to try to rein in leverage and financial excesses. There was a turndownturn in the global hightech manufacturing cycle in global auto production. There were some idiosyncratic strains in some countries like Argentina, Turkey. And then, later, in Hong Kong and Chile, you had social unrest. So, all of those things were playing into that cycle of weakening growth over the course of 2019 and the last half of ’18. I would say, now there are grounds for what I would call “cautious optimism” about the outlook now for the global economy. Many analysts are predicting a pickup in growth this year, although still to relatively modest growth rates. And I wouldpeople are pointing to, and we would point to, supportive financial conditions, the easing of trade tensions, the lower odds of a hard Brexit. The hightech manufacturing industry does appear to be rebounding well in Asia, including in China. The latest indicatorsmanufacturing PMIs, for examplesuggest that manufacturing may have bottomed out, that they’re still below 50 in many jurisdictions, but they have moved up off of their lows. I wouldI would just say, none of this is assured. As I mentioned, we saw the fourth quarter of last year came in quite weakweaker than expected. We are not at all assured of a global rebound, but there are signs and reasons to expect it. And then comes the coronavirus, which, again, it’s too early to say what the effects will be. Of course, we’re, as I mentioned, monitoring it carefully. There will clearly be implications, at least in the near term, for Chinese output and, I would guess, for some of their closein neighbors, and we’ll just have to see what the effect is globally.

So our stated goal is to keep IOER and the federal funds rate well within the range. That’s it. Well within the range. And that, clearly, you know5 basis points from the bottom or from the top isn’t that. So that’s why we moved back up. You’re right. Last year we werewe saw some tightness as reserves were draining out of the system. We saw thegradually moving up. And, in hindsight, we know what was happening. With ample reserves, we seewe see that it’s possible to bring the interest on reserves rate up to 10 basis points. So now we’renow we are well within the range, I would say.

Don’t know that. We want it to be well within the range. I think we’ll continue to adjust it to the extent it’s appropriate. Ultimately, what we’re trying to do is deliver a federal funds rate that’s well within the range. IOER is just a tool to do that. If weif we need to make changes to keep it well within the range, we’ll do that. It just meansI mean, the thing that matters for the economy is that we keep the federal funds ratewhich is the rate that, of course, transmits into other money market rates, which ultimately transmit into all kinds of financial conditionsthat’s what we care about. So, ultimately, we willwe will use that tool to keep it well within the range.

I did. I don’t thinkI’m not sure your colleagues did. [Laughter]

So I’ll go in reverse order. When wewhen we make decisions about the steps we’re going to be taking in that adjustment process that I described at some length, we’ll be making them as early as we can and as transparently as we canand specifically. But we’re not at that stage. It’s January, and we’re several months away from from that. In terms of the standing repo facility, as I mentioned in, I guess, in my answer to an earlier question, there may well be a role for repo in this system even after we’re at an ample reserves level. Now, we haven’t decided what that role is, we have not decidedwe haven’t at all made a decision on a standing repo facility. We haven’t. We’ve had a couple of discussions about it, as you know, back in, I guess, June and October. And there’s a range of views. We’re going to return, I would say, fairly soon to this question. And I think it was wise to wait, because we’re still getting a better sense of what that what that world looks like. And, you know, it’s really going to be a question of, how useful will it be? What will be the costs and benefits? And my thinking is, we will return to that fairly soon, and I wouldn’t assume a decision one way or the other. Really, we haven’t made one, because we haven’t had to. And I think youwhen you delay, you get more information by waiting. It’s good to wait. We don’t have any urgency in making that decision, because we’re still trying to find that sort of stable equilibrium where we’re in an amplereserves regime.

So that’s an interesting questionthe question being, is there a systemwide financial stability risk? I’d say, overover the longer term, it’s certainly possible, and I would say that sort of feeds into the way we’re thinking about climate change as an institution. So, as I’ve mentioned, climate change is an important issue, a very important issue, but it’s essentially assigned to many other agencies in the federal government and state governments for leadership on that. And, importantly, society’s overall response to climate change needs to be decided by elected officials and not by the Fed. All of that said, if you look at our mandate, we’ve got a monetary policy mandate and, more immediately perhaps, a supervisory mandate where we’re supervising financial markets, utilities, and financial institutions, banks. And we haven’twe share overall responsibility for financial stability with a number of agencies. And that latter partI think the public has every right to expect and will expect that we will assure that the financial system is resilient and robust against the risks from climate change. Now, I think that’s got to be right. We are in the very early stages, as are other central banks, in understanding just what that means. And there’s quite a lot of work going on around the world at other central banks and at the Fed, too, to think that through. But I do think it’sin that sense, it has to be part of our role, andbut not the overall response of society to climate change. That’s not us.

So we’ve attended all of their meetings and taken part in them, and we’ve been looking at joining in one form or another and talking to them about that. We probably will do that at some point. So that’sthat’s an ongoing question. But we’re very much attending those meetings and taking part in them.

Yes. So I guess I’d start by saying that the fact that we’ve reached a phaseone deal with China and the fact that we’ve moved ahead closer to getting USM[C]A agreedthose are potentially positive things for the economy without question. Without question. And financial marketsthe reaction of financial markets is very consistent with that perception. A sustained reduction in uncertainty over time should improve business sentiment, investment, which would provide some additional support for the economy. It’s important, though, to bear in mind a couple of things. First, trade policy uncertainty remains elevated. Businesses continue to identify it as an ongoing risk. We still have two or even three active trade discussions that are going on in the public square right now. So it hasn’t gone away, and we’ve just come through a round of talking to our vast network of comments sorry, contacts in the business world. And I think, clearly, these are seen as positive developments going forward, but there’s a bit of a waitandsee attitudeis this going to be sustained? The agreements have to be implemented, too, and that’ll take quite some time. So, I would say, we need to be a little bit patient about the effect on the economy. There’s also the global economy. You couldyou could well see manufacturingas I mentioned, manufacturing PMIs have started to tick up consistently among both advanced economies and emerging market economies. We do not see a decisive recovery, but it’s possible that this mix of positive developments and also accommodative financial conditions could spur further growth.

Yes. As for those forces, so, as we indicated, we would undertake a, you know, serious review of that question and look at both our regulations and also supervisory practices. And we’d be prepared to adjust those in ways that might encourage liquidity to flow more easily in the system as long as it didn’t undermine safety and soundness. And so we’ve undertaken that, and we’ve done a ton of work, actually. We don’t have anything to announce here today, but I feel good about thewhat we’ve learned there. I thinkyou mentioned other factors. We will be announcing our findings. I’m not going to give you a time, but we’re we’re well along in that assessment at this time. I think we also found out, though, that the level of reserves that we need in the system to conduct our operations without frequent resort to open market operations was higher than we had thought and was higher than others had thought, too. We learned that we can’t let reserveswe shouldn’t let reserves go below $1½ trillionroughly, the level of early Septemberat any point. And that means that reserves will move through in a range over the course of the year that will be substantially higher than $1½ [trillion], but they won’t ever go below. So $1½ [trillion] is not a target level. It is the bottom of a range in which reserves will be expected to move.

Well, let me just stress that we have a very specific and important reason for caring about money market operations generally, and that just is that we areour monetary policy decisions are transmitted through the financial marketsthrough the money markets into other financial markets and into broader financial conditions. So we care that money markets are operating smoothly. And they stopped operating smoothly, briefly, back in September. And so we acted. This is a onetime thing that we’re doing to adjust the level of reserves so that the money markets will be able to operate smoothly on an ongoing basis. Repo markets are important, because that’s where Treasury securitiesthe purchase of Treasury securities, which is the wayyou know, the federalpart of the way the federal government is funding its operations. It’s the way those are financed. So these are largely Treasury securities that have been purchased by dealers tofor distribution toand buyers, to a substantial extent. That’s what’s going on in the Treasury repo market. So it’s just the financing forfor that. Now, again, we don’tthat activity is ais a market activity. We’re not looking to eliminate volatility or protect anybody from volatility at all. What we care about is that volatility in the repo market can affect the transmission ofof our policy decisions to federal funds rate, and that really is important for the public.

Sure. So we will be looking tomorrow and voting on aa new part ofpart of the existing Volcker rule, and that is the covered fund provisions of the rule. And we’ll be making a bunch of proposed revisions that we believe are faithful to both the letter and the spirit of the law. We’re going to put those proposals out for public discussion, and we’re going to listen carefully, as we always do, to public comments on those proposals. Again, we believe that they will beand you’ll see them tomorrowwill be publicyou know, will be publiclywe have a Board meeting tomorrow to do that.

It’s covered funds. It’sso it’s that coveredso it’s not the proprietary trading part of Volcker. It’s the covered funds part.

Well, China has had a problem for some years, including from that period2014 up until, I guess, ’17 or ’18, and I thoughtwhich was essentially just a lot of debt for an emerging market. For an economy at theat the stage of evolution of the Chinese economy, they had very high levels of debtnot sovereign debt the way we think of it, but more business debtdebt of stateowned enterprises and also just private businesses. And a couple of years ago the authorities decided to try to get that under controlto stop the growth and to control it. And thatas I mentioned, that’s one of the reasons why Chinese growth slowed, and it’s one of the reasons why global growth slowed, because we felt that. And they’ve actually stuck to that even during this difficult period when they were experiencing, you know, strains from trade negotiations and that kind of thing. The authorities have stuck to that and have, again, continued to try to do that, soto try to control the growth of debt. And that’s important that they do that. We don’t think thatthat there’s any imminent risk there, although youas you point out, the coronavirus thing is a significant thing, which willwill have some effects on the Chinese economy, at least in the short term. The Chinese economy is very important in the global economy now. And, you know, wewhen China’s economy slows down, we do feel thatnot as much as countries, though, that are near China or that trade more actively with China, like some of the Western European countries. We still haveyou know, 85 percent of our economy is domestic. And we have a much smaller external sector, trade sector, than other economies just because of our physical location.

Well, so, two questions. I mean, in terms of liquidity, I think what we’re doing is what I said: We’re trying to raise the level of reserves back up to a level so that banks can meet their reserve requirements, and that there’s enough reserves in the system that we don’t see reserve scarcity, and we don’t have to use repo operations to provide additional reserves. So I think, as I mentioned, we believe we can get to that state at the current pace sometime in the second quarter. In terms of effects on risk assets, as I said earlier, it’s very hard to say what is affecting financial markets with any precision or confidence at a given time. It’s not our intention to change the stance of monetary policy. These were designed to provide more reserves and, really, to do that in order to enable better transmission of ourof our rate decisions into the economy under our chosen framework. That’s really the purpose of what we’re doing.

Well, as you know, we’re comfortable with our current policy stance. We think it’s appropriate. We think it’ll remain appropriate as long as data coming in are broadly in keeping with our outlook. Over timeover time, thoughlet me take a step back. Over time, an average inflationtargeting framework would be different than our current framework, in the sense that it wouldn’t be athere would be some aspect of trying to make inflation average 2 percent over time, which means, if it runs below 2 percent for a time, it has to run above to bring the average up. So that is a different framework. Our current framework is one where we sayor we’d be equally concerned with deviations of inflation from target on either side. But that isn’tthat doesn’t suggest an intention specifically to have those deviations be symmetric. In other words, that would consistent with that would be having all the deviations be on one side, which is what we’ve had, actually. So I think it is a change in framework, and over time it would lead to a different approach to policy. Again, I’m not trying toI don’t want to comment on the current stance of policy, which we do think is appropriate.

So let me say that I think this is a good time to doto update CRA, really, in a way that is a win–win both for the intended beneficiarieslow and moderate income communitiesand also for banks that would like to have more certainty aboutabout what does and doesn’t qualify and that sort of thing. The law can both be more effective and more efficient isit comes down to. And we think this is a good way. It’s also just a good time to take on board the way the delivery of banking services has changed through technology and demographic change as well. We worked very hard to try to get on the same page with the other two agencies. We been able to get there, and we still hold out some hope that we will be able to. We spent a lot of time on research and analysis and looking at meaningful reform. You saw Governor Brainard’s recent speech presenting some of the thinking and the analysis. And we haven’t made any decisions about what we’re going to do, about whether we’ll proposeI mean, our focus has been entirely on trying to get to agreement with the OCC, really. So we haven’t made any decisions about what we’re going to do going forward. In terms of, you knowGovernor Brainard led our oversight committee over these activities for many years, and I asked her to take the lead on CRA modernization, which is a high priority for us. I was comfortable with her speech, and I’m comfortable with the work we’ve done and with the Fed’s position on this. As I said, we haven’t chosen to bring a proposal forward. We haven’t decided what to do, whethergoing forward. And we’re not going to comment on the other proposal. It’s just not appropriate to do. It’s not about us. It’s not about our views. It’s about the views of the interested parties.

So I do agree thatthe principles that he articulated of firm and fair supervision and effective transparency in communications. I also think it’s a good thing that we would have brighter lines to define our LISCC supervisory portfolio, which we haven’t really had to date. Remember that when a firm moves from one portfolio to another, that doesn’t mean that its level of scrutiny or supervision will change. Soand I also thought that, you know, thehe’s raising some very interesting questions about, if youin the first part of the speech, where he’s talking about regulation and supervision and, you know, how tohow to balance the desire for transparency and due process in everything the government does with the needs of confidential supervision. It’s a very challenging question. It’s one that could use further thought. And as far as the specific, you know, proposals, there’syou know, they’re interesting, you know, and need further development and will need lots of comment and that sort of thing.

Sure. So wewe are assigned a job by Congress, and that is to use our tools to pursue maximum employment and stable prices. And that’s whatthat’s our focus. Now, monetary policy is a blunt instrument, but it’s a powerful one. So I think if you look look at the time since the financial crisis. That wasin the week [wake] of fairly modest growth, it was a powerful recovery in the labor market. And part of that just is the effect of lower interest rates. So, ifso many, many people benefit from low interest rates. In fact, you don’t hearwhen you talk to the low and moderateincome communities, one thing you don’t hear is, “You ought to raise rates.” That’s not what you hear. You hear quite the opposite, which is, you know, “Please do whatever you can to keep this expansion going.” I absolutely sympathize with people. If you’re living on just the interest in a bank or on fixedincome generally, then that’s a challenging thing. On the other hand, if you own a home, home valuesthe housing market has recovered, other financial assets have recovered, sobut, yes, for some people who are limited to those sources plus whatever other help they get, it can be challenging. I mean, we have to do what’s best for thefor the overall society and the economy. That’sthose are our orders from Congress. Thanks very much.
