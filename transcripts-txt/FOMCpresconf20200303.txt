Earlier today the Federal Open Market Committee announced a ½ percentage point reduction in the target range for the federal funds rate, bringing that range to 1 to 1¼ percent. My colleagues and I took this action to help the U.S. economy keep strong in the face of new risks to the economic outlook. The fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain strong. The unemployment rate has been near halfcentury lows for well more than a year, the pace of job gains has been solid, and wages have been rising. These strong labor market conditions have underpinned solid household spending, which has been the key driver of economic growth over the past year. At the time of our FOMC meeting in January, prospects for continued economic growth remained favorable, and we judged that monetary policy was well positioned to support that outlook. Since then, the spread of the coronavirus has brought new challenges and risks. The virus has afflicted many communities around the world, and our thoughts and prayers go out to those who’ve been harmed. The outbreak has also disrupted economic activity in many countries and has prompted significant movements in financial markets. The virus and the measures that are being taken to contain it will surely weigh on economic activity both here and abroad for some time. We are beginning to see the effects on the tourism and travel industries, and we are hearing concerns from industries that rely on global supply chains. The magnitude and persistence of the overall effects on the economy, however, remain highly uncertain, and the situation remains a fluid one. Against this background, the Committee judged that the risks to the U.S. outlook have changed materially. In response, we have eased the stance of monetary policy to provide some more support to the economy. Of course, the ultimate solutions to this challenge will come from others, particularly health professionals. We can and will do our part, however, to keep the U.S. economy strong as we meet this challenge. As always, our actions are guided by our congressional mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability. In the weeks and months ahead, we will continue to closely monitor developments and their implications for the economic outlook, and we will use our tools and act as appropriate to support the economy. Thank you, and I’ll be happy to take a few questions.

So, what changed? Of course, we’ve been carefully monitoring the situation since it first became known and waiting to see how it would evolve. And I think we’ve come to the view now that thisthat it is time for us to act in support of the economy. And once you reach that decision, we decided to go ahead. So what changed, really, was, I would say, over the course of the last couple weeks, we’ve seen a broader spread of the viruswe’ve seen it begin to spread a bit here in the United States. But, for us, what really matters, of course, is not the epidemiology, but the risk to the economy. So we saw a risk to the outlook for the economy and chose to act. In terms of my confidence that we will return towhat was your question? Was that a question?

I don’t think anybody knows how long it will be. I do know that the

Okay. So, first question. Wewe’re in active discussions with central banks around the world on an ongoing basis, as you would guess. I’ve been in regular contact with central bank leaders from around the world. That will continue. Central banks are doing what makes sense in their particular institutional contexts, but we’re all talking to each other on an ongoing basis. And our action today represents what we think is the right policy for us in our particular institutional context under our domestic mandate. You saw this morning’s G7 statement of finance ministers and governors, and I think that statement does reflect coordination at a high level in the form of a commitment to use all available tools, including healthcare policy, fiscal policy, and monetary policy as “appropriate.” So, in terms of fiscal policy, again, not our role. We havewe have a full plate with monetary policy. Not our role to give advice to the fiscal policymakers, but you saw the mention in the G7 statementas “appropriate” as well.

So the sense of the G7, you know, is towe have seven countries, obviously, and different policies, different situations, different mandatesa lot of overlap. And the sense of that is to get together as a group and say at a high level that “These are the things we’re going to do. We are going to use our toolsall of our tools in a strong way toto try to support the economy.” So that’s a statement of general support. I think within that you will see actions. You’ve seen our action. And I think it’s up to individual countriesindividual fiscal policies and individual central banksto do what they’re going to do. I would think it will be it’s possible there will be some moremore formal considered coordination as we move forward. In terms ofin terms of moving forward, I would say that we do like our current policy stance. We thinkwe think it’s appropriate toto support achievement of our dualmandate goals. But as I said in myin my statement, we’re prepared to use our toolstools and act appropriately, depending on the flow of events.

I can’t point to any one thing. It’s always a range of things.

So we don’twe don’t see any of that happening yet. Of course, we arewe are thinking about what we can do should those things happen. There’s no evidence of it yet. The economy continues to perform wellperform well. As I mentioned, we do hear concerns, particularly from those most directly exposed, but there’s nothing in that nature: Financial markets are functioning in an orderly manner and all that sort of thing. I think when itwhen it comes to those sorts of issues, though, we will bethe supervisors will be working with banks to assure that they work with theirwith their borrowers and that sort of thing. So I can imagine us doing those sorts of things, but it’sthose things are not upon us at the moment.

Well, as you know, we’re in the middle of a review of all of our tools. So if you go back a few meetings, we’ve talked about what our toolkit is, and we’ve put that in the minutes. But in the current context, no. What we discussed is the current stance of policy, is it appropriatecame to the view that it was appropriate to make a change and went ahead and did that today.

Sure, I’d be glad to. So the virus outbreak is something that will require a multifaceted response. And that response will come, in the first instance, from health care professionals and health policy experts. It will also come from fiscal authorities should they determine that a response is appropriate. And it would become from many other public and privatesector actors: businesses, schools, state and local governments. But there’s also a role for monetary policy. Monetary policy can be an effective tool to support overall economic activity. We do recognize that a rate cut will not reduce the rate of infection. It won’t fix a broken supply chain. We get that. We don’t think we have all the answers. But we do believe that our action will provide a meaningful boost to the economy. More specifically, it will support accommodative financial conditions and avoid a tightening of financial conditions which can weigh on activity, and it will help boost household and business confidence. That’s why you’re seeing central banks around the world responding as they see appropriate in their particular institutional context.

So, on your first question, we’re always going to set monetary policy at a given time in a way that we think best serves our dualmandate goals, and it’s as simple as that. So, you know, we’llif we get to a place where we think it’s an appropriate time to change the stance of monetary policy, we won’t hesitate to do that. I would also say that it’sit’s very important that people understand that we will always make our decisions based on the best thinking we have, based on ourwhat we learned from our outreach to businesses, nonprofits, educational institutions that we get every cycle through the Reserve Banks, and the best analysis, the best research. We’re always going to make our decisions in the interests of the American people to carry forward and try to achieve the mandates that Congress has given us. And we’re never going to consider any political considerations whatsoever. We will not do that, and it’s very important that the public understand that.

So we’rewe are hearingI would just say, the effects are at a very early stage. But you are hearing concerns from peoplefor example, in the travel business or the hotel business and things like that. That’sthat’s what you are hearing. But you don’t see things showing up in actual data. You do see them showing up in, sort of, sentiment forecast indicators and things like that. We expect that will continue. It will probably grow. And that’s one of the reasons why we’ve come to the view that it would be appropriate for us today to move to support the economy. And that’s what we’ve done. Thanks very much.
