Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on achieving our dual mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of the American people. While the unemployment rate remains low, it has edged up, job gains have slowed, and downside risks to employment have risen. At the same time, inflation has risen recently and remains somewhat elevated. In support of our goals, and in light of the shift in the balance of risks, today the Federal Open Market Committee decided to lower our policy interest rate by ¼ percentage point. We also decided to continue to reduce our securities holdings. I’ll have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments. Recent indicators suggest that growth of economic activity has moderated. GDP rose at a pace of around 1½ percent in the first half of the year, down from 2.5 percent last year. The moderation in growth largely reflects a slowdown in consumer spending. In contrast, business investment in equipment and intangibles has picked up from last year’s pace. Activity in the housing sector remains weak. In our Summary of Economic Projections, the median participant projects GDP to rise 1.6 percent this year and 1.8 percent next year, a touch stronger than projected in June. In the labor market, the unemployment rate edged up to 4.3 percent in August but remains little changed over the past year at a relatively low level. Payroll job gains have slowed significantly to a pace of just 29,000 per month over the past three months. A good part of the slowing likely reflects a decline in the growth of the labor force due to lower immigration and lower labor force participation. Even so, labor demand has softened, and the recent pace of job creation appears to be running below the “breakeven” rate needed to hold the unemployment rate constant. In addition, wage growth has continued to moderate, while still outpacing inflation. Overall, the marked slowing in both the supply of and demand for workers is unusual. In this less dynamic and somewhat softer labor market, the downside risks to employment appear to have risen. In our SEP, the median projection for the unemployment rate is 4.5 percent at the end of this year and edges down thereafter. Inflation has eased significantly from its highs in mid 2022 but remains somewhat elevated relative to our 2 percent longer run goal. Estimates based on the consumer price index and other data indicate that total PCE prices rose 2.7 percent over the 12 months ending in August and that, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.9 percent. These readings are higher than earlier in the year, as inflation for goods has picked up. In contrast, disinflation appears to be continuing for services. Near term measures of inflation expectations have moved up, on balance, over the course of this year on news about tariffs, as reflected in both market  and survey based measures. Beyond the next year or so, however, most measures of longer term expectations remain consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal. The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 3.0 percent this year and falls to 2.6 percent in 2026 and to 2.1 percent in 2027. Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. At today’s meeting, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point to 4 to 4¼ percent and to continue reducing the size of our balance sheet. Changes to government policies continue to evolve, and their effects on the economy remain uncertain. Higher tariffs have begun to push up prices in some categories of goods, but their overall effects on economic activity and inflation remain to be seen. A reasonable base case is that the effects on inflation will be relatively short lived a one time shift in the price level. But it is also possible that the inflationary effects could instead be more persistent, and that is a risk to be assessed and managed. Our obligation is to ensure that a one time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem. In the near term, risks to inflation are tilted to the upside and risks to employment to the downside a challenging situation. When our goals are in tension like this, our framework calls for us to balance both sides of our dual mandate. With downside risks to employment having increased, the balance of risks has shifted. Accordingly, we judged it appropriate at this meeting to take another step toward a more neutral policy stance. With today’s decision, we remain well positioned to respond in a timely way to potential economic developments. We will continue to determine the appropriate stance of monetary policy based on the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. In our SEP, FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an appropriate path for the federal funds rate, based on what each participant judges to be the most likely scenario for the economy. The median participant projects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 3.6 percent at the end of this year, 3.4 percent at the end of 2026, and 3.1 percent at the end of 2027. This path is ¼ percentage point lower than projected in June. As is always the case, these individual forecasts are subject to uncertainty, and they are not a Committee plan or decision. Policy is not on a preset course. The Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy maximum employment and stable prices. We remain committed to supporting maximum employment, bringing inflation sustainably to our 2 percent goal, and keeping longer term inflation expectations well anchored. Our success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans. We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission, and we at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals. Thank you. I look forward to our discussion.

So we did welcome a new Committee member today, as we always do, and the Committee remains united in pursuing our dual mandate goals. We’re strongly committed to maintaining our independence, and beyond that I really don’t have anything to share.

You know, it’s certainly possible. You know, we’re beginning to see we have begun to see [increased] goods prices showing through into higher inflation. And, actually, the increase in goods prices accounts for most of the increase in inflation or, perhaps, all of the increase in inflation over the course of this year. Those are not very large effects at this point. And we do expect them to continue to build over the course of the rest of the year and into next year. And it’s also possible that there may be effects on employment. But I would say, if you’re looking at why employment is doing what it’s doing, that’s much more about the change in immigration. So the supply of workers has, obviously, come way down. There’s very little growth, if any, in the supply of workers. And at the same time, demand for workers has also come down quite sharply and to the point where we see what I’ve called a “curious balance.” Typically, when we say things are “in balance,” that sounds good. But, in this case, the balance is because both supply and demand have come down quite sharply, now demand coming down a little more sharply because we see we now see the unemployment rate edging up.

So I don’t think we can say that. What we can say is this: that over the course of this year, we’ve kept our policy at a restrictive level and people have different views, but a clearly restrictive level, I would say. And we were able to do that over the course of this year because the labor market was in very solid condition, with strong job creation and all those things. I think if you go back to April and now look at the revised job creation numbers for May, June, July, and August, you can kind of I can no longer say that. So what that means is that the risks, which the risks were clearly tilted toward inflation. I would say they’re moving toward equality. Maybe they’re not quite at equality we don’t need to know that. But we do know that they’ve moved meaningfully toward greater equality the risks between the two goals and that suggests that we should be moving in the direction of neutral. And that’s what we did today.

There wasn’t widespread support at all for a 50 basis point cut today. You know, I think we’ve done we’ve done very large rate hikes and very large rate cuts in the last five years, and you tend to do those at a time when you feel that policy is out of place and needs to move quickly to a new place. That’s not at all what I feel, certainly now. I feel like our policy has been doing the right thing so far this year. I think we were right to wait and see how tariffs and inflation and the labor market evolved. I think we’re now reacting to the much lower level of job creation and other evidence of softening in the labor market and saying, well, those risks are maybe not fully balanced but moving in the direction of balance now, and so that warrants a change in policy.

Yeah, I think you could think of this, in a way, as a risk management cut, because if you look at the SEP, actually the projections for growth this year and next actually ticked up just a little bit and inflation and unemployment didn’t really move. So what’s different now? What’s different now is that you see a very different picture of the risks to the labor market. You’ve seen you know, we were looking at 150,000 jobs a month at the time of the last meeting, and now we see the revisions and we see the new numbers. And I didn’t I don’t want to put too much emphasis on payroll job creation, but it’s just one of the things that suggests that the labor market is really cooling off. And that tells you that it’s time to take that into account in our, you know, in our policy.

Yeah, so I would look at it this way. We fully understand and appreciate that we need to remain fully committed to restoring 2 percent inflation on a sustained basis, and we will do that. At the same time, we’ve got to weigh the risks to the two goals. And I would say since really, since April, to me the risks of higher and more persistent inflation have probably become a little less. And that’s partly because the labor market has softened, GDP growth has slowed. And so I would just say that the risks there have been less than one might think. And in terms of the labor market, what we’re seeing is, unemployment is still low it’s still at a relatively low rate, but we’re seeing downside risks.

Well, I was I was saying that what’s happening in the labor market has more to do with immigration than it has to do with tariffs. That was the question I was answering. So I wouldn’t say that all of what’s happening in the labor market is due to tariffs. I mean, you clearly have a slowing due to immigration. You clearly have a slowing in demand, which is now perhaps more than that in supply. And we know that because the unemployment rate has ticked up. So that’s how that’s what I meant by that.

Well, I mean, you’re right. It does say we’re going to get to 2 percent inflation in 2028 at the end of ’28. But that’s you know, that’s literally how you put the projections together. You’re writing down a rate path which is designed to create, over the course of the SEP, you know, time frame, 2 percent inflation, and maximum employment too. So that’s, that’s all that is. You know, we don’t no one really knows where the economy will be in three years, but the nature of the exercise is to write down policy that you believe would return to the 2 percent goal over the at least by the end of the exercise.

So our expectation, and you can see this consistently through the year, has been that inflation will move up this year, but that the basically, because of the effects on goods prices from tariffs but that those will turn out to be a one time price increase, as opposed to creating an inflationary process. That’s been our forecast. Pretty much every all the individual forecasts say that. We can’t just assume that, though, right? We have to our job is literally to make sure that that is what happens. And we will do that job. Right now, the situation we’re in is that we see inflation we continue to expect it to move up. Maybe not as high as we would have expected it to move up a few months ago. The pass through into of the tariffs into inflation has been slower and smaller. The labor market has softened. So the case for there being a persistent inflation outbreak is less. And so that’s why we think it’s time for us really to acknowledge that the risks to the other mandate have grown, and that we should move in the direction of neutral. So what will we do? We’ll do what we need to do. But we have two mandates, and we try to balance them. For a long time, our framework says that when our two goals are in tension this is quite an unusual situation. How do we decide what to do? Because our tools can’t do two things at once. What we do is we ask, which is farther from how far is each from the goal, and how long is it expected to get to the goal? So and then that’s we think about those things, and we see as I mentioned, we have been our policy had been really skewed toward inflation for a long time, really. Now we see that there’s downside risk clearly in the labor market. And so we’re moving in a direction of more neutral policy.

So it’s an interesting labor market. And obviously we think it’s appropriate that we reduce our rates so that we become more neutral, which will be which, presumably, will be better for the labor market. You see people who are sort of more at the margins so kids coming out of college and younger people, minorities are having a hard time finding jobs. The overall job finding rate is very, very low. However, the layoff rate is also very low. So you’ve got a low a low firing, low hiring environment. And the concern is that if you start to see layoffs, the people who are laid off won’t there won’t be a lot of hiring going on. So that could very quickly flow into higher unemployment. In a healthier economy, healthier labor market, there would be jobs for those people. But now the hiring rate is very, very low. So that’s been a growing concern over the last few months, and it’s one of the reasons why we think it’s appropriate that we begin to shift our policy focus toward a more balanced one.

So I think we are we’re in a meeting by meeting situation, and we’re going to be looking at the data. You know, let me say a word about the SEP, really, here. So we often point this out. What the SEP is, it’s an accumulation a cumulation of the individual projections of 19 people showing what they believe at a particular moment in time to be the most likely path for the economy and, thus, the appropriate path for monetary policy as well. And as you know, we don’t we don’t debate or try to agree on what that is; we just write them down and cumulate them. We do sometimes discuss them. And so we always say we’re not on a preset path, and we really mean that. The actual decisions we make are going to be based on the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks at the time the decisions are actually made. So you will have seen that we have 10 participants out of 19 who wrote down two or more cuts for the remainder of the year, and 9 who wrote down fewer than in fact, in a good number of cases no more cuts. So rather than looking at so rather than looking at this as certainty, I would encourage people, as always, to look at the SEP as through the lens of probability. And so there are there are different possible outcomes and likelihoods rather than “this one is certain, and this one isn’t happening.” So that’s what I would say.

You know, it is such an unusual situation. Ordinarily, when the labor market is weak, inflation is low; and when the labor market is really strong, that’s when you’ve got to be careful about inflation. So we have a situation where we have two sided risk, and that means there’s no risk free path. And so it’s quite a difficult situation for policymakers. And it’s not at all surprising to me that you have a range of views. It’s not so much about having different views for the path of the economy, but it’s partly that, but it’s also partly about what’s the right thing to do in light of this of the tension between the two goals. How do you weight them? How worried are you about one versus the other? And so it’s natural. I think it would actually be surprising if you didn’t have a pretty wide range of views based, you know, in this kind of highly unusual situation, and we do. But, you know, we get together, we discuss we have a great discussion, and then we decide what to do and we act. But you’re right that it is it’s a wide dispersion of views, and I think that’s understandable and natural in the current situation.

Look, it’s deeply in our culture to do to do our work based on the incoming data and never consider anything else. That’s just everybody here who’s at the Fed really feels strongly about that way. So, you know, you’ll know it by the way we talk about what we’re doing, by the speeches that people give, by the decisions that we make. You’ll know that we’re just still going to do that. That’s all we do. And we don’t we don’t frame these questions at all or see them in terms of political outcomes. I think when you get to another part of Washington, everything is seen through the lens of, does it help or hurt this political party, this politician? You know, that’s the framework. And I think people find it hard to believe that that’s just that is not at all the way we think about things at the Fed. We’re taking a longer perspective. We’re trying to, you know, serve the American people as best we can. So I think  I think you would be able to tell. I don’t I don’t believe we’ll ever get to that place. You know, I would say we’re doing our work exactly as we always have now, and people are  they’re making their arguments, and we’re having, really, a great discussion around these challenging issues. So 

You know, I see it as a court case that it would be inappropriate for me to comment on.

So, on the QCEW, the revision that we saw was almost exactly what we expected. It was amazing how close the expectation was. And the reason for that is for the last bunch of quarters, there’s been a almost a predictable overcount. And I think the, you know, the Bureau of Labor Statistics really does understand this, and they’re working hard to fix it. It’s got to do of course, it has something to do with low response rates. But it’s also got to do with what’s called the birth–death model, because a good amount of job creation happens around new companies, and how many go out of business, how many are founded. And it’s just really hard. You can’t survey for that. You’ve got to have a model that predicts that. And it’s quite difficult to do, especially when the economy is undergoing big changes. And they’ve been working on that and are making progress on it. But, you know, the data we get is still well good enough for us to do our work. To the extent we have issues around data right now, it’s about low response rates. That’s happened all over all over, really. Response rates are just lower to surveys now, both in and out of the government. And it’s no great secret. You know, we want higher response rates, and we need those to have, you know, less volatile data. And the way to get that is to make sure that the agencies that collect the data have sufficient resources to drive higher response rates. It’s not a complicated problem. But that’s what it takes. It’s not a mystery. That’s what it takes. The other thing I’ll say, Edward, is in the case of the job creation, the first the response rate is quite low for the first month, or lower for the first month. By the time you get to the second or third month, you’re still collecting responses for that last month for that prior month. And you get to the place where the data are much more reliable by the second, and certainly the third, month. So it’s not that we don’t get the data it’s just that we get it a little later.

You know, we have to live life looking through the windshield rather than the rearview mirror, as you know. And all I can tell you is we see where we are now, and we take appropriate action. And we took that appropriate action today.

Well, I hadn’t say that I thought a ¼ point would make a huge difference to the economy. But you’ve got to look at the whole path of rates, right? And the market has already has already been baking in expectations. I mean, our market works through expectations, right? So I think our policy path really does matter. And I think it’s important that we use our tools to support the labor market when we do see signs like that. I did mention that, you know, you see minority unemployment going up, you see younger people people who are more vulnerable economically, more susceptible to economic cycles. That’s one of the reasons, in addition to just overall lower payroll job creation, that shows you that at the margin the labor market is weakening. I would also point to labor force participation. Some part of the significant decline in labor force participation over the last year has probably been cyclical in nature, rather than just the usual aging process. So we put all those together, and we see that the labor market is softening, and we don’t need it to soften any more, don’t want it to. So we use our tools. And, you know, it starts with a 25 basis point rate cut, but we you know, the market’s also pricing in a rate path. I’m not blessing what the market’s doing at all. I’m just saying it’s not just one action.

I wouldn’t say that. I mean, you’re right. Those are two we’re getting unusually large amounts of economic activity through the AI build out and corporate investment. I don’t know how long that will go on. No one does. In terms of spending, you saw the consumer spending numbers were well above expectations, and that may well be skewed toward higher earning consumers. There’s a lot of anecdotal evidence to suggest that. Nonetheless, it’s spending. So, I mean, I think the economy is you know, it’s moving along. Economic growth is going to be 1½ percent or better this year, maybe a little better. Forecasts have been coming up, as you can see. So labor market is  unemployment is low, but you know, downside risks but it’s still a low unemployment rate. So that’s how we see it.

I of course, I’m not going to comment on anything the secretary says or, really, any other officer says. So in terms of reform at the Fed, you know, we just we just went through a lengthy and I think very successful process of updating our monetary policy framework. I would say there’s a lot of work going on behind the scenes around the assets we have in the Federal Reserve System and at the Board. Are they the right size? We’re actually going through a 10 percent head count reduction through the whole Fed, including the Board and all the Reserve Banks. Employment at the Fed at the end of that will be basically at the same level it was more than 10 years ago. So we will have had zero job growth for more than a decade when we’re finished with that, and I think we’ll probably do more than that. So I think we’re certainly open to constructive criticism and ways to do our jobs better.

We’re certainly open to, you know, to always trying to do better.

So there’s great uncertainty around that. I think my view which is also a bit of a guess, but widely shared I think is that you are seeing some effects, but it’s not the main thing driving it. And so a particular focus on young people coming out of college and, yeah, there may be something there. It may be that companies or other institutions that have been hiring younger people right out of college are able to use AI more than they had in the past. That may be part of the story. It’s also part of the story, though, that, you know, job creation more broadly has slowed down. The economy has slowed down. And so it’s probably a number of things. But, yeah, it’s probably a factor. Hard to say how big it is.

Well, if you you can take goods just sort of the broad goods category, and last year goods inflation was negative. If you go back 25 years, that was the typical thing was that goods inflation was goods prices generally went down, even adjusting for quality. So that was not the case during the pandemic, of course. Goods inflation went very high. But we had essentially returned to zero or slightly negative inflation. Now, I think goods inflation over the course of the past year is 1.2 percent, which doesn’t sound like a lot, but it’s a big change. So we think I mean, analysts have different views, but we think it’s contributing, you know, 0.3 or 0.4, something like that, to the current core PCE inflation reading, which is 2.9 percent. So it’s contributing. What seems to be happening is that, you know, the tariffs are not mostly not being paid by exporters, mostly being paid by, really, the companies that sit between the exporter and the consumer. So if you buy something and you sell it through retail or you use it to make a product, you’re probably taking a lot of those costs on and not able to pass it fully along to the consumer yet. That appears to be what we’re seeing. All of those companies and entities in the middle, they’ll tell you that they have every intention of passing that through in time, but they’re not doing that now. To the consumer, the pass through has been pretty small. It’s been slower and later slower and smaller than we thought. But the evidence is very clear that there’s some pass through.

I have nothing new on that for you today.

So there’s 12 voters 19 participants, of whom 12 vote, as you know, on a rotating basis. So no one voter, you know, can really the only way for any voter to really move things around is to be incredibly persuasive. And the only way to do that, in the context in which we work, is to make really strong arguments based on the data and one’s understanding of the economy. That’s really all that matters. And that’s how it’s going to work. And I think that is the way the institution that’s in the DNA of the institution. That’s not going to change.

Our response is we’re going to do everything we can to use our tools to achieve the goals that Congress has given us. And we’re not going to get distracted by anything. So I think that’s what we’re going to do. We’re just going to keep doing our jobs.

So I think there’s quite a wide assessment that the situation has changed with respect to the labor market, whereas we could still say and did say in July, at the time of the July meeting, that the labor market was in solid condition, and we could point to 150,000 jobs per month, and many other things. I think that the new data that we’ve had and it’s not just payrolls, it’s other things as well suggests that there really is meaningful downside risk. I said there was downside risk then, but I think that that downside risk is now a reality. And there’s clearly more downside risk. So I think that was I think that’s broadly accepted. And so that meant different things for different people. You know, some wrote down almost everyone wrote down support of this cut. And some supported more cuts, and some didn’t, as you will see from the dot plot. So it’s just the way that’s just the way it is. I mean, people have you have people who take this work very seriously, think about it all the time, do their work, discuss it with our colleagues. You know, we endlessly discuss this between ourselves. And then we have a meeting where we put it all out on the table. And this is what you get. And you’re right, there is a there’s a range of views in the dots. And I think that’s, like I said, very unsurprising given the quite unusual historically unusual nature of the challenges that we face. But let’s remember, though, the unemployment rate’s 4.3 percent. The economy is growing at 1½ percent. So it’s not a bad economy, or anything like that. We’ve seen much more challenging economic times. But from a policy standpoint, the standpoint of what we’re trying to accomplish, it’s challenging to know what to do. There are, as I mentioned earlier, there are no risk free paths now. It’s not incredibly obvious what to do. So we have to keep our eye on inflation. At the same time, we cannot ignore and must keep our eye on maximum employment, which is those are our two equal goals. And you will see that there are just a range of views on what to do. Nonetheless, we came together today at the meeting and acted with a high degree of unity.

You know, so there are many different ways to calculate it and none of them is perfect, but, you know, it’s clearly come way down. There are you could say it’s somewhere between zero and 50,000, and you’d be right or wrong. I mean, there’s just many different ways to do it. So wherever it was 150,000, 200,000 a few months ago it’s come down quite significantly. And that’s because a very a lower amount of people are joining the labor force. The labor force is really not growing much at this point. And that’s a lot of where the supply of labor was coming from over the last three two or three years, so we’re not getting that now. We’re also we’ve gotten much lower demand. You know, it’s interesting that supply and demand have really come down together so far, except now we do have inflation sorry, unemployment ticking up outside, just one tick outside of the range where it’s been for a year. Four point three percent is still a low level, but, you know, I think this level of this speedy decline in both supply and demand has certainly gotten everyone’s attention.

Well, that would be great. We’d love that to happen. So I don’t know that you see a big tension there, but it’s gratifying to see that economic activity is holding and you know, so it’s a good, a good bit from consumption. It looks like consumption was stronger than expected what we got earlier this week, I guess. And also we’re getting, you know a fairly narrow sector is producing a lot of economic activity, which is the AI build out and, you know, business investment. So, you know, we watch all of it. And I would say we you know, we did move up, the median for growth for this year actually moved up in the SEP between the June and September SEPs, so and, really, the inflation and labor market didn’t change much. It’s really the risks that we’re seeing to the labor market that were the focus of today’s decision.

You know, housing is an interest sensitive activity, so it’s at the very center of monetary policy. When the pandemic hit and we cut rates to zero, the housing companies were incredibly grateful and it was really they said that was the only thing that kept them going was that we cut so aggressively and provided credit and things like that, and they were able to finance because we did that. The other side of that is when inflation gets high and we raise rates and you’re right, it does burden the housing industry. And so rates have come down a bit, and as that happens we don’t set the we don’t set mortgage rates, but our policy rate changes do tend to affect mortgage rates. And that has been happening. And that’ll, of course, raise demand, lower borrowing rates for builders, will help, you know, get builders will help supply. And so some of that should happen. I think most analysts think that it would have to be pretty big changes for it to matter a lot for the big changes in rates to matter a lot for the housing sector. And, you know, the other thing is by you know, by achieving maximum employment and price stability, that’s a strong economy. That’s a good economy for housing. And then the last thing I’ll say is, you know, there’s a deeper problem here that is not a cyclical problem that the Fed can address, and that just is a pretty much nationwide housing shortage, or a lot of places in the country just don’t have enough housing for people. And, you know, all of the areas around metropolitan areas like Washington, for example are very built up, and so you’re having to build farther and farther out. And that so that’s where it is.

Well, I think we’re you know, we’re cutting the size of our balance sheet quite marginally now. As you know, with the balance sheet, we’re still in an abundant  reserves condition. And we’ve said that we would stop somewhat above a somewhat above an ample reserves level. That’s where we are. And we’re you know, we’re getting closer to that. We’re monitoring it very carefully. We don’t think that that has, at all, significant macroeconomic effects. These are pretty small numbers moving around inside a giant economy. You know, the level of runoff is not very large. So I wouldn’t attribute macroeconomic consequences to that, at this point.

So, you know, we’re aware of that. I think default rates have been kind of ticking up. And we do watch that. They’re not at a level I don’t believe they’re at a level where, overall, they’re, you know, terribly concerning. But it is something that we watch. You know, lower rates should support economic activity. I don’t know that one rate cut will have, you know, a visible effect on that. But over time, you know, a strong economy with a strong labor market is what we’re what we’re aiming for, and stable prices. So that should help.

So, as you said, shorter term inflation expectations have tended to respond to near term inflation, so if inflation goes up, inflation expectations will predict that it takes just a little while to get back down. Fortunately, throughout this period, longer term inflation expectations, both breakeven in the markets and almost all of the longer term surveys Michigan being a bit of an outlier lately have been just rock solid in terms of, you know, running at levels that are consistent with 2 percent inflation over time. So we don’t take that for granted. We actually assume that our actions have a real effect on that, and that, you know, we need to, you know, continually show and also mention/discuss our commitment to 2 percent inflation. And so you’ll hear us doing that. But, you know, we’re as I mentioned, it’s a difficult situation because we have risks that are both affecting the labor market and inflation. Those are our two goals. And so we have to balance those two. When they’re both at risk, we have to balance them, and that’s really what we’re trying to do. I don’t  the latter part of your question was about independence. You know, I don’t see market participants I don’t see that that’s something they’re factoring in right now in terms of setting interest rates. Thanks very much.
